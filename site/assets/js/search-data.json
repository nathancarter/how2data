    "content": "# About *How to Data* ## Purpose *How to Data* is a free, online reference site targeted primarily at analytics and data science students. It's organized around statistical and data-related [tasks](../tasks) and shows their implementation in a wide variety of [software packages](../software). ## Scope The website began at Bentley University and is initially targeted at the needs of students and faculty at that institution. It includes pages that organize the content around [Bentley's curriculum](../topics). But new content from other schools and businesses is always welcome, including new ways to organize existing content to better suit your organization's needs. We aim for this resource to be as broadly useful as possible. We aim for the site to cover all the tasks useful to students in the data-related courses of study at Bentley (e.g., the Data Analytics major), and show how to accomplish those tasks in several common software packages and programming languages. But we are just beginning, and are not near yet to accomplishing that goal. ## History The website was begun in Summer 2021 by Nathan Carter (a faculty member in Bentley's Mathematical Sciences Department), with help from two Bentley students. (If my students would like their names here, just let me know and I'm glad to post them, but won't do so without permission.) ## Aren't there websites like this already? Not really. Here's what I've seen, and why it's not exactly what *How to Data* is designed to accomplish. * **Software documentation** * Example: [the pandas manual](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html) * Documentation is specific to one piece of software; *How to Data* aims to show how each task is solved in many different pieces of software. * Software documentation is not organized around the courses students are taking. * **Q&A sites** * Example: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) * While an invaluable resource, such sites can have overly specific questions that don't always teach a general lesson in a didactic way. * They are also not organized around a student's coursework. * **Interactive online lessons** * Example: [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com/) * These are excellent tools for a flipped classroom or individual study, but are not excellent references; they expect you to take your own notes. * They also typically have paywalls to support their business model. * **Existing academic references** * Example: UCLA's [data analysis examples](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/dae/) and [annotated output](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/annotatedoutput/) * That website has very similar goals to *How to Data,* with one major exception---the lessons on that website are lengthy, while ours aim to be very bite-sized, answering one specific question with a short snippet of code that it's easy to take and re-use. They're aiming more to teach, while we're aiming to get you the code or steps you need to do a task. ## Why the funny name? The Internet spawns many strange and amusing new ways to speak and write. One example innovation is using the words \"how to\" followed by a noun. Examples include online images of dogs, captioned with the phrase [\"I forgot how to dog\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=i+forgot+how+to+dog&tbm=isch), or the book [*How to College*](https://www.amazon.com/How-College-Before-Youre-There-ebook/dp/B07J4NX4XF). *How to Data* follows this pattern.

    "content": "# How to add details to a plot (in Python, using Matplotlib) [See all solutions.](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) ## Task After making a plot, we might want to add axis labels, a title, gridlines, or text. Plotting packages provide tons of tools for this sort of thing. What are some of the essentials? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` The following code creates a plot with many details added, but each is independent of the others, so you can take just the bit of code that you need. ```python plt.scatter( patient_height, patient_weight ) plt.xlabel( 'This is the x axis label.' ) plt.ylabel( 'This is the y axis label.' ) plt.title( 'This is the title.' ) plt.grid() # Turns on gridlines plt.text( 70, 200, 'Text at

Plotting packages provide tons of tools for this sort of thing. What are some of the essentials? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Using Matplotlib, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot-in-python-using-matplotlib) We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` The following code creates a plot with many details added, but each is independent of the others, so you can take just the bit of code that you need. ```python plt.scatter( patient_height, patient_weight ) plt.xlabel( 'This is the x axis label.' ) plt.ylabel( 'This is the y axis label.' ) plt.title( 'This is the title.' ) plt.grid() # Turns on gridlines plt.text( 70, 200, 'Text at

(See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('ToothGrowth') ``` To visually plot the means of the length of the tooth based on the Vitamin C dosage levels we can create a pointplot.

) The point plot informs us that as the dosage levels increase, the tooth length also increases. To obtain the actual numbers, we can use the `groupby` function to compute the treatment level means, and the `mean` function to compute the mean for the entire column. ```python df.groupby('dose')['len'].mean() ``` dose 0.5 10.605 1.0 19.735 2.0 26.100 Name: len, dtype: float64 ```python df['len'].mean() ``` 18.813333333333336 If you wish to display the difference between the overall mean and the group means, you can subtract the overall mean from the treatment level means. ```python df.groupby('dose')['len'].mean() - df['len'].mean() ``` dose 0.5 -8.208333 1.0 0.921667 2.0 7.286667 Name: len, dtype: float64 Content last modified on 26 July 2021.

(See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('ToothGrowth') ``` To visually plot the means of the length of the tooth based on the Vitamin C dosage levels we can create a pointplot.

) The point plot informs us that as the dosage levels increase, the tooth length also increases. To obtain the actual numbers, we can use the `groupby` function to compute the treatment level means, and the `mean` function to compute the mean for the entire column. ```python df.groupby('dose')['len'].mean() ``` dose 0.5 10.605 1.0 19.735 2.0 26.100 Name: len, dtype: float64 ```python df['len'].mean() ``` 18.813333333333336 If you wish to display the difference between the overall mean and the group means, you can subtract the overall mean from the treatment level means. ```python df.groupby('dose')['len'].mean() - df['len'].mean() ``` dose 0.5 -8.208333 1.0 0.921667 2.0 7.286667 Name: len, dtype: float64 Content last modified on 26 July 2021.

These include the range of each axis, which points on that axis are marked with tick marks, and whether the axes use linear or logarithmic scaling. How can we customize these options? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` You can change the plot range and where tick marks are shown, in either the $x$ or $y$ directions (or both) as follows. ```python plt.scatter( patient_height, patient_weight ) plt.xlim( [ 0, 80 ] ) # Plot from x=0 to x=80. plt.ylim( [ 0, 250 ] ) # Plot from y=0 to y=250. plt.xticks( range(0,80,10) ) # Put x axis ticks every 10 units. plt.yticks( range(0,250,50) ) # Y ticks every 50. You can provide any list. plt.show() ```

These include the range of each axis, which points on that axis are marked with tick marks, and whether the axes use linear or logarithmic scaling. How can we customize these options? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Using Matplotlib, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot-in-python-using-matplotlib) We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` You can change the plot range and where tick marks are shown, in either the $x$ or $y$ directions (or both) as follows. ```python plt.scatter( patient_height, patient_weight ) plt.xlim( [ 0, 80 ] ) # Plot from x=0 to x=80. plt.ylim( [ 0, 250 ] ) # Plot from y=0 to y=250. plt.xticks( range(0,80,10) ) # Put x axis ticks every 10 units. plt.yticks( range(0,250,50) ) # Y ticks every 50. You can provide any list. plt.show() ```

    "content": "# How to check the assumptions of a linear model (in Python, using NumPy, SciPy, sklearn, Matplotlib and Seaborn) [See all solutions.](../how-to-check-the-assumptions-of-a-linear-model) ## Task If you plan to use a linear model to describe some data, it's important to check if it satisfies the assumptions for linear regression. How can we do that? ## Solution When performing a linear regression, the following assumptions should be checked. ### 1. We have two or more columns of numerical data of the same length. The solution below uses an example dataset about car design and fuel consumption from a 1974 Motor Trend magazine. (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) We can see that our columns all have the same length. ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('mtcars') df = df[['mpg','cyl','wt']] # Select the 3 variables we're interested in df.info() ``` RangeIndex: 32 entries, 0 to 31 Data columns (total 3 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 mpg 32 non-null float64 1 cyl 32 non-null int64 2 wt 32 non-null float64 dtypes: float64(2), int64(1) memory usage: 896.0 bytes ### 2. Scatter plots we've made suggest a linear relationship. Scatterplots are covererd in [how to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots), but after making the model, we can also examine the residuals. So let's make the model. Our predictors will be the number of cylinders and the weight of the car and the response will be miles per gallon. (See also [how to fit a linear model to two columns of data](../how-to-fit-a-linear-model-to-two-columns-of-data).) ```python from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression model = LinearRegression() predictors = df[['cyl','wt']] response = df['mpg'] model.fit( X=predictors, y=response ) predictions = model.predict(predictors) ``` We test for linearity with residual plots. We show just one residual plot here; you should make one for each predictor.

) ### 3. After making the model, the residuals seem normally distributed. We can check this by constructing a Q-Q plot, which compares the distribution of the residuals to a normal distribution. SciPy's `stats` module has a `probplot` function for this purpose.

) ### 4. After making the model, the residuals seem homoscedastic. This assumption is sometimes called \"equal variance,\" and can be checked by the `regplot` function in Seaborn. We must first standardize the residuals, which we can do with NumPy. We want to see a plot with no clear pattern; a cone shape to the data would indicate heteroscedasticity, the opposite of homoscedasticity. ```python import numpy as np standardized_residuals =

How can we do that? ## Using NumPy, SciPy, sklearn, Matplotlib and Seaborn, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-check-the-assumptions-of-a-linear-model-in-python-using-numpy-scipy-sklearn-matplotlib-and-seaborn) When performing a linear regression, the following assumptions should be checked. ### 1. We have two or more columns of numerical data of the same length. The solution below uses an example dataset about car design and fuel consumption from a 1974 Motor Trend magazine. (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) We can see that our columns all have the same length. ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('mtcars') df = df[['mpg','cyl','wt']] # Select the 3 variables we're interested in df.info() ``` RangeIndex: 32 entries, 0 to 31 Data columns (total 3 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 mpg 32 non-null float64 1 cyl 32 non-null int64 2 wt 32 non-null float64 dtypes: float64(2), int64(1) memory usage: 896.0 bytes ### 2. Scatter plots we've made suggest a linear relationship. Scatterplots are covererd in [how to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots), but after making the model, we can also examine the residuals. So let's make the model. Our predictors will be the number of cylinders and the weight of the car and the response will be miles per gallon. (See also [how to fit a linear model to two columns of data](../how-to-fit-a-linear-model-to-two-columns-of-data).) ```python from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression model = LinearRegression() predictors = df[['cyl','wt']] response = df['mpg'] model.fit( X=predictors, y=response ) predictions = model.predict(predictors) ``` We test for linearity with residual plots. We show just one residual plot here; you should make one for each predictor. Seaborn has a function for just this purpose. ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # The \"lowess\" parameter adds a smooth line through the data: sns.residplot(x = df['wt'], y = response, data=df, lowess=True) plt.xlabel(\"Weight\") plt.title('Miles per gallon') plt.show() ```

) ### 3. After making the model, the residuals seem normally distributed. We can check this by constructing a Q-Q plot, which compares the distribution of the residuals to a normal distribution. SciPy's `stats` module has a `probplot` function for this purpose.

) ### 4. After making the model, the residuals seem homoscedastic. This assumption is sometimes called \"equal variance,\" and can be checked by the `regplot` function in Seaborn. We must first standardize the residuals, which we can do with NumPy. We want to see a plot with no clear pattern; a cone shape to the data would indicate heteroscedasticity, the opposite of homoscedasticity. ```python import numpy as np standardized_residuals =

If we are planning to conduct a study, how do we determine how large it should be in order to have a certain power? ## Solution Example: Let's say we're designing a study to assess the effectiveness of a new four-week exercise program for weight loss. Assume that weight loss in four-week exercise programs is normally distributed with a standard deviation of around 5 pounds. The goal is that the new exercise program will have a 4-pound higher weight loss than the average program. We choose a value $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$ as the probability of a Type I error (false positive, finding we should reject $H_0$ when it’s actually true). Let's set $\\alpha$ to be 0.05 here. We choose a value $0 \\le \\beta \\le 1$ as the probability of a Type II error (false negative, failing to reject $H_0$ when it’s actually false). Let's set $\\beta$ to be 0.2 here. The test's power is $1-\\beta$, or in this case, 0.8. What should the sample size be for each group? ```R # sd = standard deviation = 5 pounds # delta = desired increase = 4 pounds # sig.level = alpha = 0.05 # power = 1 - beta = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 # n = NULL so R computes it for us power.t.test(n = NULL, delta = 4, sd = 5, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80) ``` Two-sample t test power calculation n = 25.52463 delta = 4 sd = 5 sig.level = 0.05 power = 0.8 alternative = two.sided NOTE: n is number in *each* group Our sample size needs to be 26 participants in order for the power of the study to be 80% with our specified parameters.

Assume that weight loss in four-week exercise programs is normally distributed with a standard deviation of around 5 pounds. The goal is that the new exercise program will have a 4-pound higher weight loss than the average program. We choose a value $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$ as the probability of a Type I error (false positive, finding we should reject $H_0$ when it’s actually true). Let's set $\\alpha$ to be 0.05 here. We choose a value $0 \\le \\beta \\le 1$ as the probability of a Type II error (false negative, failing to reject $H_0$ when it’s actually false). Let's set $\\beta$ to be 0.2 here.

Let's assume we've chosen a confidence level of $\\alpha$ = 0.05. ## Using NumPy and SciPy, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-compute-a-confidence-interval-for-a-mean-difference-matched-pairs-in-python-using-numpy-and-scipy) We'll use Numpy and SciPy to do some statistics later. ```python import numpy as np from scipy import stats ``` This example computes a 95% confidence interval, but you can choose a different level by choosing a different value for $\\alpha$. ```python alpha = 0.05 ``` We have two samples of data, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_k$ and $x'_1, x'_2, x'_3, \\ldots, x'_k$. We're going to use some fake data below just as an example; replace it with your real data. ```python sample1 = np.array([15, 10, 7, 22, 17, 14]) sample2 = np.array([ 9, 1, 11, 13, 3, 6]) ``` And now the computations: ```python diff_samples = sample1 - sample2 # differences between the samples n = len(sample1) # number of observations per sample diff_mean = np.mean(diff_samples) # mean of the differences diff_variance = np.var( diff_samples, ddof=1 ) # variance of the differences critical_val = stats.t.ppf(q = 1-alpha/2, df = n - 1) # critical value radius = critical_val*np.sqrt(diff_variance)/np.sqrt(n) # radius of confidence interval ( diff_mean - radius, diff_mean + radius ) # confidence interval ``` (0.7033861582274517, 13.296613841772547) Our 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is $[0.70338, 13.2966]$.

We're going to use some fake data below just as an example; replace it with your real data. ```R sample.1 <- c(15, 10, 7, 22, 17, 14) sample.2 <- c(9, 1, 11, 13, 3, 6) ``` The shortest way to create the confidence interval is with R's `t.test()` function. It's just one line of code (after we choose $\\alpha$). ```R alpha <- 0.05 # replace with your chosen alpha (here, a 95% confidence level) t.test(sample.1, sample.2, paired = TRUE, conf.level = 1-alpha) ``` Paired t-test data: sample.1 and sample.2 t = 2.8577, df = 5, p-value = 0.0355 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.7033862 13.2966138 sample estimates: mean of the differences 7 If you need the lower and upper bounds later, you can save them as variables as follows. ```R conf.interval <- t.test(sample.1, sample.2, paired = TRUE, conf.level = 1-alpha) lower.bound <- conf.interval$conf.int[1] upper.bound <- conf.interval$conf.int[2] ``` It's also possible to do the computation manually, using the code below. ```R diff.samples <- sample.1 - sample.2 # differences between the samples n = length(sample.1) # number of observations per sample diff.mean <- mean(diff.samples) # mean of the differences diff.variance <- var( diff.samples ) # variance of the differences critical.val <- qt(p = alpha/2, df = n - 1, lower.tail=FALSE) # critical value radius <- critical.val*sqrt(diff.variance)/sqrt(n) # radius of confidence interval c( diff.mean - radius, diff.mean + radius ) # confidence interval ``` [1] 0.7033862 13.2966138 Either method gives the same result.

EuStockMarkets <- data.frame(EuStockMarkets) sample <- EuStockMarkets$DAX ``` Now that we have our sample data loaded, let's go ahead and make the confidence interval. ```R # Find the critical values from the right and left tails of the Chi-square distribution alpha <- 0.05 # replace with your chosen alpha (here, a 95% confidence level) n <- length(sample) left_critical_val <- qchisq(p = alpha/2, df = n-1, lower.tail=FALSE) right_critical_val <- qchisq(p = 1-alpha/2, df = n-1, lower.tail=FALSE) # Find the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval and print them out lower_bound <- ((n - 1)*var(sample))/left_critical_val upper_bound <- ((n - 1)*var(sample))/right_critical_val lower_bound upper_bound ``` [1] 1104642 [1] 1256248 Our 95% confidence interval for the standard deviation of Germany's DAX closing prices is $[1104642, 1256248]$.

For example, if we are trying a drug on experimental and control groups of patients, we probably want to compare the proportion of patients who got well in one group versus the other. How do we make such a comparison using a confidence interval? ## Solution Here is some fake data for the purposes of this illustration. Let's say we conduct a survey of people in Boston and of people in Nashville and ask them if they prefer chocolate or vanilla ice cream. We want to compare the proportions of people from the two cities who like vanilla. * Out of 150 people in Boston surveyed, 90 prefer vanilla. * Out of 135 people in Nashville surveyed, 50 prefer vanilla. We'll let $\\bar{p_1}$ represent the proportion of people from Boston who like vanilla and $\\bar{p_2}$ represent the proportion of people from Nashville who like vanilla. You can replace the code for this fake data below with your real data. ```python # number of observations in the samples n1 = 150 n2 = 135 # proportions in the two samples p_bar1 = 90/150 p_bar2 = 50/135 ``` We now compute the confidence interval using tools from SciPy and NumPy. ```python # Find the critical value to compute the confidence interval from scipy import stats alpha = 0.05 # replace with your chosen alpha (here, a 95% confidence level) critical_value = stats.norm.ppf(1-alpha/2) # Compute the standard error of the proportions import numpy as np std_error = np.sqrt( p_bar1*(1-p_bar1)/n1 + p_bar2*(1-p_bar2)/n2 ) # Compute the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval upper_bound = (p_bar1 - p_bar2) + critical_value*std_error lower_bound = (p_bar1 - p_bar2) - critical_value*std_error lower_bound, upper_bound ``` (0.11657216971616415, 0.3426870895430951) The confidence interval for the difference between these two proportions is $[0.11657, 0.34269]$.

For example, if we are trying a drug on experimental and control groups of patients, we probably want to compare the proportion of patients who got well in one group versus the other. How do we make such a comparison using a confidence interval? ## Solution Here is some fake data for the purposes of this illustration. Let's say we conduct a survey of people in Boston and of people in Nashville and ask them if they prefer chocolate or vanilla ice cream. We want to compare the proportions of people from the two cities who like vanilla. * Out of 150 people in Boston surveyed, 90 prefer vanilla. * Out of 135 people in Nashville surveyed, 50 prefer vanilla. We'll let $\\bar{p_1}$ represent the proportion of people from Boston who like vanilla and $\\bar{p_2}$ represent the proportion of people from Nashville who like vanilla.

Note that every column in a DataFrame is a pandas series. ```python np.cov( df['col1'], df['col2'] ) ``` array([[ 0.09645398, -0.00955601], [-0.00955601, 0.05878234]]) You can also compare all of a DataFrame's columns among one another, each as a separate variable. ```python df.cov() ``` col1 col2 col3 col4 col5 col1 0.096454 -0.009556 -0.052318 0.013896 -0.009116 col2 -0.009556 0.058782 -0.028798 0.033634 0.011250 col3 -0.052318 -0.028798 0.111899 -0.043065 0.015956 col4 0.013896 0.033634 -0.043065 0.058399 -0.016705 col5 -0.009116 0.011250 0.015956 -0.016705 0.099596 The Pearson correlation coefficient can be computed with `np.corrcoef` in place of `np.cov`. ```python np.corrcoef( df['col1'], df['col2'] ) ``` array([[ 1. , -0.12690915], [-0.12690915, 1. ]]) And pandas DataFrames have a built in method to do this for all numeric columns. ```python df.corr() ``` col1 col2 col3 col4 col5 col1 1.000000 -0.126909 -0.503593 0.185146 -0.093005 col2 -0.126909 1.000000 -0.355079 0.574052 0.147034 col3 -0.503593 -0.355079 1.000000 -0.532730 0.151143 col4 0.185146 0.574052 -0.532730 1.000000 -0.219035 col5 -0.093005 0.147034 0.151143 -0.219035 1.000000 Content last modified on 23 July 2021.

    "content": "# How to conduct a repeated measures ANOVA ## Description In a repeated measures test, the same subject receives multiple treatments. When you have a dataset that includes the responses of a repeated measures test where the measurements are dependent (within subjects design), you may wish to check if there is a difference in the treatment effects. How would you conduct a repeated measures ANOVA to answer that question? Related tasks: * [How to do a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)](../how-to-do-a-one-way-analysis-of-variance-anova) * How to compare two linear models using ANOVA * [How to conduct a mixed designs ANOVA](../how-to-conduct-a-mixed-designs-anova) * [How to perform an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)](../how-to-perform-an-analysis-of-covariance-ancova) ## Using pandas and pingouin, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-conduct-a-repeated-measures-anova-in-python-using-pandas-and-pingouin) We create a hypothetical repeated measures dataset where the 5 subjects undergo all 4 skin treatments and their rating of the treatment is measured. ```python import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame( { 'Subject': [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5], 'Skin Treatment': ['W','X','Y','Z','W','X','Y','Z','W','X', 'Y','Z','W','X','Y','Z','W','X','Y','Z'], 'Rating': [7,5,8,4,8,10,7,5,7,6,5,4,7,7,4,5,8,8,6,6] } ) df.head() ``` Subject Skin Treatment Rating 0 1 W 7 1 1 X 5 2 1 Y 8 3 1 Z 4 4 2 W 8 Before we conduct a repeated measures ANOVA, we need to decide which approach to use - Univariate or Multivariate. We decide this using Mauchly's test of sphericity. If we fail to reject the null hypothesis then we use the univariate approach. * $H_0 =$ the sphericity assumption holds * $H_A =$ the sphericity assumption is violated We use the `pingouin` statistics package to conduct the test. Most of the parameters below are self-explanatory, except that `dv` stands for dependent variable. ```python import pingouin as pg pg.sphericity( dv='Rating', within='Skin Treatment', subject='Subject', method='mauchly', data=df ) ``` SpherResults(spher=True, W=0.06210054956238558, chi2=7.565056754547507, dof=5, pval=0.20708214225927316) Since the $p$ value of `skin_treatment` is about $0.2071$, we fail to reject the sphericity assumption at a 5% significance level and use the univariate approach to conduct the repeated measures ANOVA. ```python # Compute a repeated measures ANOVA using a function pingouin adds to our DataFrame: df.rm_anova( dv='Rating', within='Skin Treatment', subject='Subject', detailed=False ) ``` Source ddof1 ddof2 F p-unc np2 eps 0 Skin Treatment 3 12 5.117647 0.016501 0.56129 0.541199 Since the $p$ value of about $0.017$ is less that the 5% significance level, we conclude that there is significant evidence of a treatment effect.

It is a simplified way to see the distribution of a variable. Sometimes multiple box plots (one for each of several variables) are shown side-by-side on a plot, to compare the variables. How can we create such graphs? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` To create a box-and-whisker plot, sometimes called just a box plot requires just one line of code, plus one to show the plot. ```python plt.boxplot( patient_height ) plt.show() ```

    "content": "# How to create a box (and whisker) plot ## Description A box plot, or a box and whisker plot, shows the quartiles of a single variable from a dataset (one of which is the median) and may also show the outliers. It is a simplified way to see the distribution of a variable. Sometimes multiple box plots (one for each of several variables) are shown side-by-side on a plot, to compare the variables. How can we create such graphs? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Using Matplotlib, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot-in-python-using-matplotlib) We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66,

This can be useful for creating small tables for testing purposes, or for creating small lookup tables that hold abbreviations, IDs, etc. What's the easiest way to build such a table? ## Solution In pandas, the `pd.DataFrame` function can construct new DataFrames. Just provide it with a dictionary whose keys are the column headers and whose values are the column contents. Here's an example: ```python import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame( { 'Last name' : [ 'Potter', 'Weasley', 'Granger', 'Malfoy' ], 'First name' : [ 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Draco' ], 'House' : [ 'Gryffindor', 'Gryffindor', 'Gryffindor', 'Slytherin' ] } ) df ``` Last name First name House 0 Potter Harry Gryffindor 1 Weasley Ron Gryffindor 2 Granger Hermione Gryffindor 3 Malfoy Draco Slytherin Content last modified on 26 July 2021.

This can be useful for creating small tables for testing purposes, or for creating small lookup tables that hold abbreviations, IDs, etc. What's the easiest way to build such a table? ## Solution In R, the `data.frame` function can be used to build data frames. Each column in your data should be a separate parameter, with its name provided, followed by an equals sign, followed by the vector of column contents, as shown in the example below. ```R data <- data.frame( last.name = c( 'Potter', 'Weasley', 'Granger', 'Malfoy' ), first.name = c( 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Draco' ), house = c( 'Griffindor', 'Griffindor', 'Griffindor', 'Slytherin' ) ) data ``` last.name first.name house 1 Potter Harry Griffindor 2 Weasley Ron Griffindor 3 Granger Hermione Griffindor 4 Malfoy Draco Slytherin Content last modified on 26 July 2021.

Just provide it with a dictionary whose keys are the column headers and whose values are the column contents. Here's an example: ```python import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame( { 'Last name' : [ 'Potter', 'Weasley', 'Granger', 'Malfoy' ], 'First name' : [ 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Draco' ], 'House' : [ 'Gryffindor', 'Gryffindor', 'Gryffindor', 'Slytherin' ] } ) df ``` Last name First name House 0 Potter Harry Gryffindor 1 Weasley Ron Gryffindor 2 Granger Hermione Gryffindor 3 Malfoy Draco Slytherin Content last modified on 26 July 2021.

    "content": "# How to create a histogram (in Python, using Matplotlib) [See all solutions.](../how-to-create-a-histogram) ## Task A histogram is a very common and useful data visualization. It displays an approximation of the distribution in single series of data points (one variable) by grouping the data into bins, each bin draw as a vertical bar. How can we create such a visualization? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution We will create some random data using NumPy, but that's just for demonstration purposes. You can apply the answer below to any data, even if it's stored just in plain Python lists. ```python import numpy as np data = np.random.normal( size=1000 ) ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` To create a histogram with 10 bins (the default): ```python plt.hist( data ) # or plt.hist( bins=20 ), or any number plt.show() ```

It displays an approximation of the distribution in single series of data points (one variable) by grouping the data into bins, each bin draw as a vertical bar. How can we create such a visualization? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Using Matplotlib, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-create-a-histogram-in-python-using-matplotlib) We will create some random data using NumPy, but that's just for demonstration purposes. You can apply the answer below to any data, even if it's stored just in plain Python lists. ```python import numpy as np data = np.random.normal( size=1000 ) ``` The conventional way to import

How can we create those? Related topics: * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` Make a line plot by giving the $x$ and $y$​ data values in separate lists (or in this case pandas Series). This line plot is very jagged just because the data was random. ```python plt.plot( patient_id, patient_height ) # create plot plt.show() # display plot ```

How can we create those? Related topics: * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Using Matplotlib, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-create-basic-plots-in-python-using-matplotlib) We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` Make a line plot by giving the $x$ and $y$​ data values in separate lists (or in this case pandas Series). This line plot is very jagged just because the data was random. ```python plt.plot( patient_id, patient_height ) # create plot plt.show() # display plot ```

How would we visually compare the treatment conditions with regards to the outcome variable? Related tasks: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution The solution below uses an example dataset about the teeth of 10 guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels (in mg) with two delivery methods (orange juice vs. ascorbic acid). (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('ToothGrowth') ``` If you wish to understand the distribution of a numeric variable (here \"len\") compared across different values of a categorical variable (here \"supp\"), you can construct a bivariate histogram. We use Seaborn and Matplotlib to do so. ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt sns.displot(df, x=\"len\", col=\"supp\", stat=\"density\") plt.show() ```

) Even more simply, we may wish to plot just the means and 95% confidence intervals around the mean for the quantitative variable, for each of the values of the categorical variable. We do so with a point plot. ```python sns.pointplot(x = 'supp', y = 'len', data = df, ci = 95, # Which confidence interval? Here 95%. capsize = 0.1) # Size of \"cap\" drawn on each confidence interval. plt.show() ```

    "content": "# How to create bivariate plots to compare groups ## Description Suppose we have a dataset with different treatment conditions and an outcome variable, and we want to perform exploratory data analysis. How would we visually compare the treatment conditions with regards to the outcome variable? Related tasks: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups-in-python-using-matplotlib-and-seaborn) The solution below uses an example dataset about the teeth of 10 guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels (in mg) with two delivery methods (orange juice vs. ascorbic acid). (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('ToothGrowth') ``` If you wish to understand the distribution of a numeric variable (here \"len\") compared across different values of a categorical variable (here \"supp\"), you can construct a bivariate histogram. We use Seaborn and Matplotlib to do so. ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt sns.displot(df, x=\"len\", col=\"supp\", stat=\"density\") plt.show() ```

(Let's assume that sequences are indexed starting with index 0, at $a_0$, even though some definitions start with index 1, at $a_1$, instead.) How can we express sequences in mathematical software?

Related tasks: * [How to graph mathematical functions](../how-to-graph-mathematical-functions) * [How to graph mathematical sequences](../how-to-graph-mathematical-sequences) ## Solution This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output ``` First, we need a two-variable function that we wish to plot. ```python var( 'x y' ) formula = sin( x**2 + y**2 ) formula ``` $\\displaystyle \\sin{\\left(x^{2} + y^{2} \\right)}$ You can use `plot3d`, but you have to import it

Related tasks: * [How to graph mathematical functions](../how-to-graph-mathematical-functions) * [How to graph mathematical sequences](../how-to-graph-mathematical-sequences) ## Using SymPy, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-graph-a-two-variable-function-as-a-surface-in-python-using-sympy) This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output ``` First, we need a two-variable function that we wish to plot. ```python var( 'x y' ) formula = sin( x**2 + y**2 )

(The standard example is the formula for the unit circle, $x^2+y^2=1$.) We would still like to be able to use software to plot such curves. How? Related tasks: * [How to graph mathematical functions](../how-to-graph-mathematical-functions) * [How to do implicit differentiation](../how-to-do-implicit-differentiation) ## Solution This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output ``` Let's consider the example of the unit circle, $x^2+y^2=1$. To plot it, SymPy first expects us to move everything to the left-hand side of the equation, so in this case, we would have $x^2+y^2-1=0$.

(The standard example is the formula for the unit circle, $x^2+y^2=1$.) We would still like to be able to use software to plot such curves. How? Related tasks: * [How to graph mathematical functions](../how-to-graph-mathematical-functions) * [How to do implicit differentiation](../how-to-do-implicit-differentiation) ## Using SymPy, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-graph-curves-that-are-not-functions-in-python-using-sympy) This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output ``` Let's consider the example of the unit circle, $x^2+y^2=1$. To plot it, SymPy first expects us to move everything to the left-hand side of the equation, so in this case, we would have $x^2+y^2-1=0$. We then use that left hand side to represent the equation as a single formula, and we can plot it with SymPy's `plot_implicit` function. ```python var( 'x y' ) formula = x**2 + y**2 - 1 # to represent x^2+y^2=1 plot_implicit( formula ) ```

Related tasks: * [How to graph curves that are not functions](../how-to-graph-curves-that-are-not-functions) * [How to graph mathematical sequences](../how-to-graph-mathematical-sequences) * [How to graph a two-variable function as a surface](../how-to-graph-a-two-variable-function-as-a-surface) ## Solution Let's assume we want to graph the function $x^2-5x+9$ from $x=-10$ to $x=10$. Let's import NumPy for the mathematics and Matplotlib for the graph. ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` We compute a series of $(x,y)$ pairs to generate the plot. Notice how NumPy automatically computes a $y$ value for each $x$ value if we just include all the $x$s in the formula we wish to graph. ```python xs = np.linspace( -10, 10, 100 ) # 100 values from x=-10 to x=10 ys = xs**2 - 5*xs + 9 # compute all corresponding ys plt.plot( xs, ys ) plt.show() ```

Related tasks: * [How to graph curves that are not functions](../how-to-graph-curves-that-are-not-functions) * [How to graph mathematical sequences](../how-to-graph-mathematical-sequences) * [How to graph a two-variable function as a surface](../how-to-graph-a-two-variable-function-as-a-surface) ## Solution This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * #

Related tasks: * [How to graph curves that are not functions](../how-to-graph-curves-that-are-not-functions) * [How to graph mathematical sequences](../how-to-graph-mathematical-sequences) * [How to graph a two-variable function as a surface](../how-to-graph-a-two-variable-function-as-a-surface) ## Solution Let's assume we want to graph the function $x^2-5x+9$ from $x=-10$ to $x=10$. We compute a series of $(x,y)$ pairs to generate the plot. Notice how R automatically computes a $y$ value for each $x$ value if we just include all the $x$s in the formula we wish to graph. ```R xs <- seq(-10,10,length.out=100) # 100 values from x=-10 to x=10 ys <- xs^2 - 5*xs + 9 # compute all corresponding ys plot( xs, ys, type='l' ) ``` ![png](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA0gAAANICAMAAADKOT/pAAADAFBMVEUAAAABAQECAgIDAwME

Related tasks: * [How to graph curves that are not functions](../how-to-graph-curves-that-are-not-functions) * [How to graph mathematical sequences](../how-to-graph-mathematical-sequences) * [How to graph a two-variable function as a surface](../how-to-graph-a-two-variable-function-as-a-surface) ## Using NumPy and Matplotlib, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-graph-mathematical-functions-in-python-using-numpy-and-matplotlib) Let's assume we want to graph the function $x^2-5x+9$ from $x=-10$ to $x=10$. Let's import NumPy for the mathematics and Matplotlib for the graph. ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` We compute a series of $(x,y)$ pairs to generate the plot. Notice how NumPy automatically computes a $y$ value for each $x$ value if we just include all the $x$s in the formula we wish to graph. ```python xs = np.linspace( -10, 10, 100 ) # 100 values from x=-10 to x=10 ys = xs**2 - 5*xs + 9 # compute all corresponding ys plt.plot( xs, ys ) plt.show() ```

We compute a series of $(x,y)$ pairs to generate the plot. Notice how R automatically computes a $y$ value for each $x$ value if we just include all the $x$s in the formula we wish to graph. ```R xs <- seq(-10,10,length.out=100) # 100 values from x=-10 to x=10 ys <- xs^2 - 5*xs + 9 # compute all corresponding ys plot( xs, ys, type='l' ) ``` ![png](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA0gAAANICAMAAADKOT/pAAADAFBMVEUAAAABAQECAgIDAwME

The result will not look like a curve, because a sequence is separate points instead of a smooth curve. Related tasks: * [How to graph mathematical functions](../how-to-graph-mathematical-functions) * [How to define a mathematical sequence](../how-to-define-a-mathematical-sequence) ## Solution This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output ``` We will re-use the sequence defined in the task [how to define a mathematical sequence](../how-to-define-a-mathematical-sequence). ```python var( 'n' ) a_n = 1 / ( n + 1 ) seq = sequence( a_n, (n,0,oo) ) seq ``` $\\displaystyle

If we would like to compare the pairs without any corrections, we can use the 'pairwise t test' in the `scikit_posthocs` package. ```python import scikit_posthocs as sp sp.posthoc_ttest(df, val_col='count', group_col='spray', p_adjust=None, pool_sd=True ) ``` A B C D E \\ A 1.000000e+00 6.044761e-01 7.266893e-11 9.816910e-08 2.753922e-09 B 6.044761e-01 1.000000e+00 8.509776e-12 1.212803e-08 3.257986e-10 C 7.266893e-11 8.509776e-12 1.000000e+00 8.141205e-02 3.794750e-01 D 9.816910e-08 1.212803e-08 8.141205e-02 1.000000e+00 3.794750e-01 E 2.753922e-09 3.257986e-10 3.794750e-01 3.794750e-01 1.000000e+00 F 1.805998e-01 4.079858e-01 2.794343e-13 4.035610e-10 1.054387e-11 F A 1.805998e-01 B 4.079858e-01 C 2.794343e-13 D 4.035610e-10 E 1.054387e-11 F 1.000000e+00 Techniques to adjust the above table for multiple comparisons include the Bonferroni correction, Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) method, Dunnett’s procedure, and Scheffe’s method. These can be used in place of 'None' for the `p.adjust` argument; [see details here](https://scikit-posthocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/scikit_posthocs.posthoc_ttest/). You can also determine the magnitude of these differences; see [how to perform post-hoc analysis with Tukey's HSD test](../how-to-perform-post-hoc-analysis-with-tukey-s-hsd-test).

Related tasks: * [How to do a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)](../how-to-do-a-one-way-analysis-of-variance-anova) * [How to perform pairwise comparisons](../how-to-perform-pairwise-comparisons) ## Solution We load here the same data that appears in the solution for [how to perform pairwise comparisons](../how-to-perform-pairwise-comparisons). That solution determined which pairs of groups have significant differences in their means; follow its link for more details. ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('InsectSprays') df.head() ``` count spray 0 10 A 1 7 A 2 20 A 3 14 A 4 14 A We now want to perform a unplanned comparison test on the data to determine the magnitudes of the differences between pairs of groups. We do this by applying \"Tukey’s HSD\" approach to perform pairwise comparisons and generate confidence intervals that maintain a specified experiment-wise error rate. Before that, the `pairwise_tukeyhsd` module needs to be imported from the `statsmodels` package. ```python from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog=df['count'], groups=df['spray'], alpha=0.05) print(tukey) ``` Multiple Comparison of Means - Tukey HSD, FWER=0.05 ===================================================== group1 group2 meandiff p-adj lower upper reject ----------------------------------------------------- A B 0.8333 0.9 -3.8659 5.5326 False A C -12.4167 0.001 -17.1159 -7.7174 True A D -9.5833 0.001 -14.2826 -4.8841 True A E -11.0 0.001 -15.6992 -6.3008 True A F 2.1667 0.728 -2.5326 6.8659 False B C -13.25 0.001 -17.9492 -8.5508 True B D -10.4167 0.001 -15.1159 -5.7174 True B E -11.8333 0.001 -16.5326 -7.1341 True B F 1.3333 0.9 -3.3659 6.0326 False C D 2.8333 0.4921 -1.8659 7.5326 False C E 1.4167 0.9 -3.2826 6.1159 False C F 14.5833 0.001 9.8841 19.2826 True D E -1.4167 0.9 -6.1159 3.2826 False D F 11.75 0.001 7.0508 16.4492 True E F 13.1667 0.001 8.4674 17.8659 True ----------------------------------------------------- Because the above table contains a lot of information, it's often helpful to visualize these intervals. Python's `statsmodels` package does not have a built-in way to do so, but we can create our own as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt rows = tukey.summary().data[1:] plt.hlines( range(len(rows)), [row[4] for row in rows], [row[5] for row in rows] ) plt.vlines( 0, -1, len( rows )-1, linestyles='dashed' ) plt.gca().set_yticks( range( len( rows ) ) ) plt.gca().set_yticklabels( [ f'{x[0]}-{x[1]}' for x in rows ] ) plt.show() ```

We do this by applying \"Tukey’s HSD\" approach to perform pairwise comparisons and generate confidence intervals that maintain a specified experiment-wise error rate. Before that, the `pairwise_tukeyhsd` module needs to be imported from the `statsmodels` package. ```python from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog=df['count'], groups=df['spray'], alpha=0.05) print(tukey) ``` Multiple Comparison of Means - Tukey HSD, FWER=0.05 ===================================================== group1 group2 meandiff p-adj lower upper reject ----------------------------------------------------- A B 0.8333 0.9 -3.8659 5.5326 False A C -12.4167 0.001 -17.1159 -7.7174 True A D -9.5833 0.001 -14.2826 -4.8841 True A E -11.0 0.001 -15.6992 -6.3008 True A F 2.1667 0.728 -2.5326 6.8659 False B C -13.25 0.001 -17.9492 -8.5508 True B D -10.4167 0.001 -15.1159 -5.7174 True B E -11.8333 0.001 -16.5326 -7.1341 True B F 1.3333 0.9 -3.3659 6.0326 False C D 2.8333 0.4921 -1.8659 7.5326 False C E 1.4167 0.9 -3.2826 6.1159 False C F 14.5833 0.001 9.8841 19.2826 True D E -1.4167 0.9 -6.1159 3.2826 False D F 11.75 0.001 7.0508 16.4492 True E F 13.1667 0.001 8.4674 17.8659 True ----------------------------------------------------- Because the above table contains a lot of information, it's often helpful to visualize these intervals. Python's `statsmodels` package does not have a built-in way to do so, but we can create our own as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt rows = tukey.summary().data[1:] plt.hlines( range(len(rows)), [row[4] for row in rows], [row[5] for row in rows] ) plt.vlines( 0, -1, len( rows )-1, linestyles='dashed' ) plt.gca().set_yticks( range( len( rows ) ) ) plt.gca().set_yticklabels( [

How can we get access to them in software, to plot the distribution as a curve? Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot discrete probability distributions](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions) ## Solution You can import many different random variables from SciPy's `stats` module. The full list of them is online [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#discrete-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. But we can just ask SciPy to show us the central 99.98% of a continuous distribution, which is almost always indistinguishable to the human eye from the entire distribution. We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is continuous. ```python from scipy import stats X = stats.norm( 10, 5 ) # use a normal distribution with μ=10 and σ=5 xmin = X.ppf( 0.0001

    "content": "# How to plot continuous probability distributions (in R) [See all solutions.](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions) ## Task There are many famous continuous probability distributions, such as the normal and exponential distributions. How can we get access to them in software, to plot the distribution as a curve? Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot discrete probability distributions](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions) ## Solution Because R is designed for use in statistics, it comes with many probability distributions built in. A list of them is online [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Probability-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. But we can just ask R to show us the central 99.98% of a continuous distribution, which is almost always indistinguishable to the human eye from the entire distribution. We will use a normal distribution with $\\mu=10$ and $\\sigma=5$, but if you wanted to use a different distribution, you could replace `qnorm` and `dnorm` with, for example, `qchisq` and `dchisq` (for the $\\chi^2$ distribution), adjusting the named parameters as appropriate. (For a list of supported distributions, see the link above.) We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is continuous. ```R xmin <- qnorm( 0.0001, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute min x as the 0.0001 quantile xmax <- qnorm( 0.9999, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute max x as the 0.9999 quantile xs <- seq( xmin, xmax, length.out=100 ) # create 100 values in that range ys <- dnorm( xs, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute the shape of the distribution plot( xs, ys, type='l' ) # plot that shape as a smooth line ``` ![png](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA0gAAANICAMAAADKOT/pAAADAFBMVEUAAAABAQECAgIDAwME

How can we get access to them in software, to plot the distribution as a curve? Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot discrete probability distributions](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions) ## Using SciPy, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions-in-python-using-scipy) You can import many different random variables from SciPy's `stats` module. The full list of them is online [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#discrete-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. But we can just ask SciPy to show us the central 99.98% of a continuous distribution, which is almost always indistinguishable to the human eye from the entire distribution. We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is continuous. ```python from scipy import stats X = stats.norm( 10, 5 ) # use a normal distribution with μ=10 and σ=5 xmin = X.ppf( 0.0001

A list of them is online [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Probability-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. But we can just ask R to show us the central 99.98% of a continuous distribution, which is almost always indistinguishable to the human eye from the entire distribution. We will use a normal distribution with $\\mu=10$ and $\\sigma=5$, but if you wanted to use a different distribution, you could replace `qnorm` and `dnorm` with, for example, `qchisq` and `dchisq` (for the $\\chi^2$ distribution), adjusting the named parameters as appropriate. (For a list of supported distributions, see the link above.) We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is continuous. ```R xmin <- qnorm( 0.0001, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute min x as the 0.0001 quantile xmax <- qnorm( 0.9999, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute max x as the 0.9999 quantile xs <- seq( xmin, xmax, length.out=100 ) # create 100 values in that range ys <- dnorm( xs, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute the shape of the distribution plot( xs, ys, type='l' ) # plot that shape as a smooth line ``` ![png](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA0gAAANICAMAAADKOT/pAAADAFBMVEUAAAABAQECAgIDAwME

How can we get access to them in software, to plot the distribution as a series of points? Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot continuous probability distributions](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions) ## Solution You can import many different random variables from SciPy's `stats` module. The full list of them is online [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#discrete-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. The example below uses a geometric distribution, whose sample space is $\\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}$. We specify that we just want to use $x$ values in the set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$. (In some software, the geometric distribution's sample space begins at 0, but not in SciPy.) We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is discrete. ```python from scipy import stats X = stats.geom( 0.5 ) # use a geometric distribution with p=0.5 import numpy as np xs =

    "content": "# How to plot discrete probability distributions (in R) [See all solutions.](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions) ## Task There are many famous discrete probability distributions, such as the binomial and geometric distributions. How can we get access to them in software, to plot the distribution as a series of points? Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot continuous probability distributions](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions) ## Solution Because R is designed for use in statistics, it comes with many probability distributions built in. A list of them is online [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Probability-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. The example below uses a geometric distribution (with $p=0.5$), whose sample space is $\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\}$. We specify that we just want to use $x$ values in the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$. (In some software, the geometric distribution's sample space begins at 1, but not in R.) If you wanted to use a different distribution, you could replace `dgeom` with, for example, `dbinom`, adjusting the named parameters as appropriate. We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is discrete. ```R xs = 0:8 # choose the sample space (here, it's 0,1,2,...,10) ys = dgeom( xs, prob=0.5 ) # compute the shape of the distribution plot( xs, ys, type='p', # plot circles... xlab='sample space', ylab='probability' ) segments( xs, 0, xs, ys ) # ...and lines ```

    "content": "# How to plot discrete probability distributions ## Description There are many famous discrete probability distributions, such as the binomial and geometric distributions. How can we get access to them in software, to plot the distribution as a series of points? Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot continuous probability distributions](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions) ## Using SciPy, in Python [View this solution alone.](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions-in-python-using-scipy) You can import many different random variables from SciPy's `stats` module. The full list of them is online [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#discrete-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. The example below uses a geometric distribution, whose sample space is $\\\\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\\\}$. We specify that we just want to use $x$ values in the set $\\\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\\\}$. (In some software, the geometric distribution's sample space begins at 0, but not in SciPy.) We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is discrete. ```python from scipy import stats X = stats.geom( 0.5 ) # use a geometric distribution with p=0.5 import numpy as np xs =

A list of them is online [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Probability-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. The example below uses a geometric distribution (with $p=0.5$), whose sample space is $\\\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\\\}$. We specify that we just want to use $x$ values in the set $\\\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,10\\\\}$. (In some software, the geometric distribution's sample space begins at 1, but not in R.) If you wanted to use a different distribution, you could replace `dgeom` with, for example, `dbinom`, adjusting the named parameters as appropriate. We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is discrete. ```R xs = 0:8 # choose the sample space (here, it's 0,1,2,...,10) ys = dgeom( xs, prob=0.5 ) # compute the shape of the distribution plot( xs, ys, type='p', # plot circles... xlab='sample space', ylab='probability' ) segments( xs, 0, xs, ys ) # ...and lines ```

How can we create the right kind of plot for that situation? * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) ## Solution The solution below uses an example dataset about the teeth of 10 guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels (in mg) with two delivery methods (orange juice vs. ascorbic acid). (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('ToothGrowth') ``` To plot the interaction effects among tooth

) Looking at the output, we first see that there is an interaction effect because the two supp lines intersect. We also see that there is a difference in length when giving 0.5mg and 1mg dosage of either of the two delivery methods. However, there is barely any difference between the delivery methods when the dosage level is 2mg. Content last modified on 26 July 2021. See a problem?

) Looking at the output, we first see that there is an interaction effect because the two supp lines intersect. We also see that there is a difference in length when giving 0.5mg and 1mg dosage of either of the two delivery methods. However, there is barely any difference between the delivery methods when the dosage level is 2mg. Content last modified on 26 July 2021. See a problem?

And it's handy to be able to quickly load some example data to work with. There is a lot of freely available sample data out there. What's the easiest way to load it? ## Solution The R programming language comes with many free datasets built in. To make these same datasets available to Python programmers as well, you can install and import the `rdatasets` package. First, ensure that you have it installed, by running `pip install rdatasets` or `conda install rdatasets` from your command line.

In this case, that makes the equation $\\frac{dy}{dx}-y=0$, and we will use just the left-hand side to express our ODE. ```python ode = dydx - y ode ``` $\\displaystyle - y{\\left(x \\right)} + \\frac{d}{d x} y{\\left(x \\right)}$ Content last modified on 02 June 2021.
