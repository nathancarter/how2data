It includes pages that organize the content around Bentley’s curriculum. But new content from other schools and businesses is always welcome, including new ways to organize existing content to better suit your organization’s needs. We aim for this resource to be as broadly useful as possible. We aim for the site to cover all the tasks useful to students in the data-related courses of study at Bentley (e.g., the Data Analytics major), and show how to accomplish those tasks in several common software packages and programming languages. But the site is just beginning, and does not yet cover every data-related course at Bentley. ",

Let's model temperature as the dependent variable with the logarithm of pressure as the independent variable. To transform the independent variable pressure, we use NumPy's `np.log` function, as shown below. It uses the natural logarithm (base $e$). ```python import numpy as np # Compute the logarithm of pressure X = pressure[['pressure']] log_X = np.log(X) # Build the linear model using Scikit-Learn from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression y = pressure['temperature'] log_model = LinearRegression() log_model.fit(log_X, y) # Display regression coefficients and R-squared value of the model log_model.intercept_, log_model.coef_, log_model.score(log_X, y) ``` (153.97045660511063, array([23.78440995]), 0.9464264282083346) The model is $\\hat t = 153.97 + 23.784\\log p$, where $t$ stands for temperature and $p$ for pressure. Another example transformation is the square root transformation. As with `np.log`, just apply the `np.sqrt` function to the appropriate term when defining the model. ```python # Compute the square root of pressure X = pressure[['pressure']] sqrt_X = np.sqrt(X) # Build the linear model using Scikit-Learn from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression y = pressure['temperature'] sqrt_model = LinearRegression() sqrt_model.fit(sqrt_X, y) # Display regression coefficients and R-squared value of the model sqrt_model.intercept_, sqrt_model.coef_, sqrt_model.score( log_X, y ) ``` (98.56139249917803, array([11.44621468]), 0.29600246256782614) The model is $\\hat t = 98.561 + 11.446\\sqrt{p}$, with $t$ and $p$ having the same meanings as above.

Plotting packages provide tons of tools for this sort of thing. What are some of the essentials? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` The following code creates a plot with many details added, but each is independent of the others, so you can take just the bit of code that you need. ```python plt.scatter( patient_height, patient_weight ) plt.xlabel( 'This is the x

    "content": "# How to analyze the sample means of different treatment conditions (in Python, using Matplotlib and Seaborn) [See all solutions.](../how-to-analyze-the-sample-means-of-different-treatment-conditions) ## Task In a single-factor experiment with three or more treatment levels, how can we compare them to see which one impacts the outcome variable the most? ## Solution The solution below uses an example dataset about the teeth of 10 guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels (in mg) with two delivery methods (orange juice vs. ascorbic acid). (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('ToothGrowth') ``` To visually plot the means of the length of the tooth based on the Vitamin C dosage levels we can create a pointplot. We will have to import the `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot` packages to be able to create it. ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt sns.pointplot( x = 'dose', y = 'len',

    "content": "# How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot (in Python, using Matplotlib) [See all solutions.](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) ## Task The mathematical markings and measurements in a plot can make a big difference on its readability and usefulness. These include the range of each axis, which points on that axis are marked with tick marks, and whether the axes use linear or logarithmic scaling. How can we customize these options? Related topics: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` You can change the plot range and where tick marks are shown, in either the $x$ or $y$ directions (or both) as follows. ```python plt.scatter( patient_height, patient_weight ) plt.xlim( [ 0, 80 ] ) # Plot from x=0 to x=80. plt.ylim( [ 0, 250 ] ) # Plot from y=0 to y=250. plt.xticks( range(0,80,10) ) # Put x axis ticks every 10 units. plt.yticks( range(0,250,50) ) # Y ticks every 50. You can provide any list. plt.show() ```

    "content": "# How to check the assumptions of a linear model (in Python, using NumPy, SciPy, sklearn, Matplotlib and Seaborn) [See all solutions.](../how-to-check-the-assumptions-of-a-linear-model) ## Task If you plan to use a linear model to describe some data, it's important to check if it satisfies the assumptions for linear regression. How can we do that? ## Solution When performing a linear regression, the following assumptions should be checked. ### 1. We have two or more columns of numerical data of the same length. The solution below uses an example dataset about car design and fuel consumption from a 1974 Motor Trend magazine. (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) We can see that our columns all have the same length. ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('mtcars') df = df[['mpg','cyl','wt']] # Select the 3 variables we're interested in df.info() ``` RangeIndex: 32 entries, 0 to 31 Data columns (total 3 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 mpg 32 non-null float64 1 cyl 32 non-null int64 2 wt 32 non-null float64 dtypes: float64(2), int64(1) memory usage: 896.0 bytes ### 2. Scatter plots we've made suggest a linear relationship. Scatterplots are covererd in [how to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots), but after making the model, we can also examine the residuals. So let's make the model. Our predictors will be the number of cylinders and the weight of the car and the response will be miles per gallon. (See also [how to fit a linear model to two columns of data](../how-to-fit-a-linear-model-to-two-columns-of-data).) ```python from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression model = LinearRegression() predictors = df[['cyl','wt']] response = df['mpg'] model.fit( X=predictors, y=response ) predictions = model.predict(predictors) ``` We test for linearity with residual plots. We show just one residual plot here; you should make one for each predictor. Seaborn has a function for just this purpose.

) ### 3. After making the model, the residuals seem normally distributed. We can check this by constructing a QQ-plot, which compares the distribution of the residuals to a normal distribution.

) ### 4. After making the model, the residuals seem homoscedastic. This assumption is sometimes called \"equal variance,\" and can be checked by the `regplot` function in Seaborn. We must first standardize the residuals, which we can do with NumPy. We want to see a plot with no clear pattern; a cone shape to the data would indicate heteroscedasticity, the opposite of homoscedasticity. ```python import numpy as np standardized_residuals =

In such a situation, how can we determine if the larger model (in this case $B$) is significantly better than the smaller (reduced) model? We can use an Extra Sums of Squares test, also called a partial $F$-test, to compare two nested linear. This technique will also help us with another question. If we have a multivarate linear model, $$\\hat{y}=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_kx_k,$$ how can we test the influence of only some of the coefficients? If we remove some of the coefficients, we have a smaller model nested in the larger one, so the question is the same.

But this is not the only way to create nested models; it is just an example. ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('mtcars') ``` Consider a model using number of cylinders (cyl) and weight of car (wt) to predict its fuel efficiency (mpg). We create this model and perform an ANOVA to see if the predictors are significant. We use the Ordinary Least Squares module from `statsmodels`. ```python from statsmodels.formula.api import ols add_model = ols('mpg ~ cyl + wt', data = df).fit() import statsmodels.api as sm sm.stats.anova_lm(add_model, typ= 1) ``` | | df | sum_sq | mean_sq | F | PR(&gt;F) | . | cyl | 1.0 | 817.712952 | 817.712952 | 124.043687 | 5.424327e-12 | . | wt | 1.0 | 117.162269 | 117.162269 | 17.773034 | 2.220200e-04 | . | Residual | 29.0 | 191.171966 | 6.592137 | NaN | NaN | . In the final column of output we see that all numbers are below $0.05$, which suggests that both predictors are significant. A natural question to ask is whether the two predictors have an interaction effect. Let's create a model containing the interaction term. ```python int_model = ols('mpg ~ cyl*wt', data = df).fit() sm.stats.anova_lm(int_model, typ= 1) ``` | | df | sum_sq | mean_sq | F | PR(&gt;F) | . | cyl | 1.0 | 817.712952 | 817.712952 | 145.856269 | 1.280635e-12 | . | wt | 1.0 | 117.162269 | 117.162269 | 20.898350 | 8.942713e-05 | . | cyl:wt | 1.0 | 34.195767 | 34.195767 | 6.099533 | 1.988242e-02 | . | Residual | 28.0 | 156.976199 | 5.606293 | NaN | NaN | . As seen in the final column of output, there is a significant interaction between the two predictors (bottom number being below $0.05$). We now have one model (`add_model`) nested inside a larger model (`int_model`). To check which model is better, we can conduct an ANOVA comparing the two models. We use the `anova_lm` function from `statsmodels`. ```python from statsmodels.stats.anova import anova_lm anova_lm(add_model, int_model) ``` | | df_resid | ssr | df_diff | ss_diff | F | Pr(&gt;F) | . | 0 | 29.0 | 191.171966 | 0.0 | NaN | NaN | NaN | . | 1 | 28.0 | 156.976199 | 1.0 | 34.195767 | 6.099533 | 0.019882 | . We have just performed this hypothesis test: $H_0 =$ the two models are equally useful for predicting the outcome $H_a =$ the larger model is significantly better than the smaller model In the final column of the output, called **Pr(>F)**, the only number in that column is our test statistic, $0.019882$. Since is below our chosen threshold of $0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis, and prefer to use the second model. This method can be used to check if covariates should be included in the model, or if additional variables should be added as well. Content last modified on 30 November 2021. See a problem?

If you do not have the population standard deviation, but your sample is large enough (typically at least 30), you can approximate the population standard deviation with the sample standard deviation, using the code `std = stats.tstd( data )`. If your sample is not that large, then consider using a different technique instead; see [how to compute a confidence interval for a population mean](../how-to-compute-a-confidence-interval-for-a-population-mean). 2.

You can replace it with your actual data. ```python import statsmodels.api as sm xs = [ 34, 9, 78, 60, 22, 45, 83, 59, 25 ] ys = [ 126, 347, 298, 309, 450, 187, 266, 385, 400 ] xs = sm.add_constant( xs ) model = sm.OLS( ys, xs ) results = model.fit() ``` We can use Python’s `conf_int()` function to find the confidence interval for the model coefficients. You can change the `alpha` parameter to specify a different significance level. Note that if you have a multiple regression model, it will make confidence intervals for all of the coefficient values. ```python results.conf_int( alpha=0.05 ) ``` array([[172.63807531, 535.52642049], [ -4.49196063, 2.47393542]]) Each list in the array represents the 95% confidence interval for the corresponding coefficient in the model beginning with the intercept and each regression coefficient thereafter. Accordingly, the 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficient is $[-4.49196063,2.47393542]$. Content last modified on 21 June 2022. See a problem?

Replace our fake data with your actual data if you use this code. ```python sample1 = [15, 10, 7, 22, 17, 14] sample2 = [9, 1, 11, 13, 3, 6] ``` We will need the sizes, means, and variances of each sample. ```python import numpy as np n_sample1 = len(sample1) n_sample2 = len(sample2) xbar1 = np.mean(sample1) xbar2 = np.mean(sample2) var_sample1 = np.var(sample1, ddof = 1) var_sample2 = np.var(sample2, ddof = 1) ``` Before we can compute the confidence interval, we must ask, can we assume that the two population variances are equal? ***IF YES:*** We compute the degrees of freedom and the radius of the confidence interval as follows. ```python df = n_sample1 + n_sample2 - 2 pooled_var = ((n_sample1-1)*var_sample1 + (n_sample2-1)*var_sample2) / df radius = pooled_var*(1/n_sample1 + 1/n_sample2) ``` ***IF NO:*** We *replace* the above code with the following code instead, which does not make the assumption that the population variances are equal. ~~~python # ratio1 = var_sample1/n_sample1 # ratio2 = var_sample2/n_sample2 # df = (ratio1 + ratio2)**2 / (ratio1**2/(n_sample1-1) + ratio2**2/(n_sample2-1)) # radius = ratio1 + ratio2 ~~~ Then, whichever of the two methods above was used, we compute the confidence interval as follows. ```python from scipy import stats # Find the critical value from the normal distribution alpha = 0.05 critical_val = stats.t.ppf(q = 1-alpha/2, df = df) # Find the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval upper_bound = (xbar1 - xbar2) + critical_val*np.sqrt(radius) lower_bound = (xbar1 - xbar2) - critical_val*np.sqrt(radius) lower_bound, upper_bound ``` (0.5980039236697818, 13.401996076330217) The 95% confidence interval for the true difference between these population means is $[0.598,13.402]$. That was computed under the assumption that the variances were equal. See the alternative code above for if the variances were not assumed to be equal; in that case, we would get the slightly different result of $[0.5852, 13.4147]$ instead.

For example, if we are trying a drug on experimental and control groups of patients, we probably want to compare the proportion of patients who got well in one group versus the other.

For a review of how this preparatory code works, see [how to fit a linear model to two columns of data](../how-to-fit-a-linear-model-to-two-columns-of-data). ```python import statsmodels.api as sm # Replace the following fake data with your actual data: xs = [ 34, 9, 78, 60, 22, 45, 83, 59, 25 ] ys = [ 126, 347, 298, 309, 450, 187, 266, 385, 400 ] # Create and fit a linear model to the data: xs = sm.add_constant( xs ) model = sm.OLS( ys, xs ).fit() ``` Ask the model to do a prediction of one particular input, in this example $x=40$, with a $95\\%$ confidence interval included ($\\alpha=0.05$). You can replce the $40$ with your chosen $x$ value, or an array of them, and you can replace the $0.05$ with your chosen value of $\\alpha$. (The extra `1` in the input to `get_prediction` is a placeholder, required because the model has been expanded to include a constant term.) ```python model.get_prediction( [1,40] ).summary_frame( alpha=0.05 ) ``` | | mean | mean_se | mean_ci_lower | mean_ci_upper | obs_ci_lower | obs_ci_upper | . | 0 | 313.721744 | 36.823483 | 226.648043 | 400.795444 | 45.876725 | 581.566762 | . Our 95% confidence interval is $[226.648, 400.7954]$. We can be 95% confident that the true average value of $y$, given that $x$ is 40, is between 226.648 and 400.7954.

Note that every column in a DataFrame is a pandas series. ```python np.cov( df['col1'], df['col2'] ) ``` array([[0.10369366, 0.08926178], [0.08926178, 0.10982211]]) You can also compare all of a DataFrame's columns among one another, each as a separate variable. ```python df.cov() ``` | | col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 | col5 | . | col1 | 0.103694 | 0.089262 | -0.029498 | -0.005259 | 0.056009 | . | col2 | 0.089262 | 0.109822 | -0.068362 | 0.014306 | 0.050707 | . | col3 | -0.029498 | -0.068362 | 0.107503 | 0.003484 | 0.004916 | . | col4 | -0.005259 | 0.014306 | 0.003484 | 0.070548 | -0.017955 | . | col5 | 0.056009 | 0.050707 | 0.004916 | -0.017955 | 0.093274 | . The Pearson correlation coefficient can be computed with `np.corrcoef` in place of `np.cov`. ```python np.corrcoef( df['col1'], df['col2'] ) ``` array([[1. , 0.83645878], [0.83645878, 1. ]]) And pandas DataFrames have a built in method to do this for all numeric columns. ```python df.corr() ``` | | col1 | col2 | col3 | col4 | col5 | . | col1 | 1.000000 | 0.836459 | -0.279384 | -0.061490 | 0.569506 | . | col2 | 0.836459 | 1.000000 | -0.629158 | 0.162532 | 0.501009 | . | col3 | -0.279384 | -0.629158 | 1.000000 | 0.040002 | 0.049098 | . | col4 | -0.061490 | 0.162532 | 0.040002 | 1.000000 | -0.221339 | . | col5 | 0.569506 | 0.501009 | 0.049098 | -0.221339 | 1.000000 | .

Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot continuous probability distributions](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions) * [How to plot discrete probability distributions](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions) ## Solution If the probability distribution is a common *discrete* distribution, you can simply use a built-in function from Excel’s set of statistical functions to compute any probability from it. For example, to find the probability that a binomial random variable with p=0.25 yields 3 successes in 5 trials, you can use =BINOM.DIST(3,5,0.25,FALSE). The final parameter, FALSE, tells Excel you are asking only about 3 successes, not the cumulative probability of *up to 3* successes. For other discrete random variables, see the Excel help on POISSON.DIST and HYPGEOM.DIST. If the probability distribution is a common *continuous* distribution, you must ask about the probability of a random value falling in a certain range. You do so by subtracting two outputs of the cumulative distribution function (CDF). For example, to find the probability that a normal random variable with mean 5 and standard deviation 2 falls in the interval \\[6,7\\], you can use =NORM.DIST(7,5,2,TRUE)-NORM.DIST(6,5,2,TRUE). Notice: - It is important to subtract the lower end of the interval from the higher end, not the other way around. (If your probability comes out negative, you have it backwards.) - The final parameter, TRUE, tells Excel you are using the CDF of the distribution. If you use FALSE instead, you will get a wrong answer. For other continuous random variables, see the Excel help on BETA.DIST, CHISQ.DIST, F.DIST, GAMMA.DIST, LOGNORM.DIST, and T.DIST.

Related tasks: * [How to summarize a column](../how-to-summarize-a-column) * [How to summarize and compare data by groups](../how-to-summarize-and-compare-data-by-groups) ## Solution Let’s assume you have some data in an Excel workbook. We show the first 10 rows the famous example dataset “iris” below, but we assume you are applying what we cover here to your own real data. To compute descriptive statistics, you will need the Data Analysis Toolpak. If you’ve never enabled it before, see [these instructions from Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-analysis-toolpak-in-excel-6a63e598-cd6d-42e3-9317-6b40ba1a66b4#OfficeVersion=Windows) on how to do so. On the Data tab, click the Data Analysis button, shown below. From the list of tools it provides, choose Descriptive Statistics, as shown below, then click OK. Highlight as input *only the numeric columns in your data,* because the Data Analysis Toolpak cannot summarize other kinds of input. (Do not include column headers in your selection.) Then check the “Summary statistics” checkbox, as shown below. Then click OK. Excel will create a new sheet that reports the mean, median, variance, and more, for each column, as shown below. To get a report of the unique values in your column and the frequency of each, you can use a pivot table. Place your cursor anywhere in your data, then on the Insert tab, choose Pivot Table, as shown below. Drag any column’s name from the list of pivot table fields down into both the Rows and Values areas, as shown below. If the column is numeric, then in the drop-down under Values, choose “Value field settings…” and change Sum to Count, then click OK. This is not necessary for non-numeric columns. (See [how to summarize a column](../how-to-summarize-a-column) for an example.) Your pivot table will now contain the desired report. In the iris dataset used in this example, there were precisely 50 observations of each variety. Content last modified on 21 June 2022. See a problem?

    "content": "View this solution alone. Let’s assume you have some data in an Excel workbook. We show the first 10 rows the famous example dataset “iris” below, but we assume you are applying what we cover here to your own real data. To compute descriptive statistics, you will need the Data Analysis Toolpak. If you’ve never enabled it before, see these instructions from Microsoft on how to do so. On the Data tab, click the Data Analysis button, shown below. From the list of tools it provides, choose Descriptive Statistics, as shown below, then click OK. Highlight as input only the numeric columns in your data, because the Data Analysis Toolpak cannot summarize other kinds of input. (Do not include column headers in your selection.) Then check the “Summary statistics” checkbox, as shown below. Then click OK. Excel will create a new sheet that reports the mean, median, variance, and more, for each column, as shown below. To get a report of the unique values in your column and the frequency of each, you can use a pivot table. Place your cursor anywhere in your data, then on the Insert tab, choose Pivot Table, as shown below. Drag any column’s name from the list of pivot table fields down into both the Rows and Values areas, as shown below. If the column is numeric, then in the drop-down under Values, choose “Value field settings…” and change Sum to Count, then click OK. This is not necessary for non-numeric columns. (See how to summarize a column for an example.) . Your pivot table will now contain the desired report. In the iris dataset used in this example, there were precisely 50 observations of each variety.

We show here how to do such a test, even though it does not apply to this situation. We must first reorganize the data into a matrix where each row represents a single subject, and columns represent levels of the treatment factor.

That $p$-value could be compared to a chosen $\\alpha$. (We also see that Mauchly’s test was performed, which is not significant, and is the reason this data actually demands a univariate approach.)

We then create a multivariate model and also set up a variable that defines the design of the study. | 1 2 3 4 . | # In this model there are no between-subjects factors, so we write ~ 1: multi.ml &lt;- lm(multi.data ~ 1) # The design of the study is a single factor with four levels: rfactor &lt;- factor(c(\"f1\", \"f2\", \"f3\", \"f4\")) . | . Conduct the repeated measures ANOVA using a multivariate approach. This requires creating a new model using the Anova() function that calculates ANOVA tables. The car package provides the Anova() function. The parameters have the following meanings. | idata includes information about the number of levels, in this case four. | idesign states that rfactor describes a repeated-measures variable. | type tells Anova() to calculate the “Type-III” sums of squares when forming the ANOVA table. | multivariate suppresses output about multivariate statistical tests, which are relevant only when the experimental design includes multiple dependent variables. | . | 1 2 3 4 . | # install.packages(\"car\") # If you have not already installed it library(car) multi.ml &lt;- Anova(multi.ml, idata=data.frame(rfactor), idesign = ~rfactor, type=\"III\") summary(multi.ml, multivariate=FALSE) . | . | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 . | Loading required package: carData Univariate Type III Repeated-Measures ANOVA Assuming Sphericity Sum Sq num Df Error SS den Df F value Pr(&gt;F) (Intercept) 806.45 1 11.8 4 273.3729 7.837e-05 *** rfactor 21.75 3 17.0 12 5.1176 0.0165 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Mauchly Tests for Sphericity Test statistic p-value rfactor 0.062101 0.20708 Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt Corrections for Departure from Sphericity GG eps Pr(&gt;F[GG]) rfactor 0.5412 0.05068 . --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 HF eps Pr(&gt;F[HF]) rfactor 0.858156 0.02319302 . | .

It is a simplified way to see the distribution of a variable. Sometimes multiple box plots (one for each of several variables) are shown side-by-side on a plot, to compare the variables. How can we create such graphs?

But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66,

    "content": "A box plot, or a box and whisker plot, shows the quartiles of a single variable from a dataset (one of which is the median) and may also show the outliers. It is a simplified way to see the distribution of a variable. Sometimes multiple box plots (one for each of several variables) are shown side-by-side on a plot, to compare the variables.

    "content": "# How to create a QQ-plot (in Python, using SciPy) [See all solutions.](../how-to-create-a-qq-plot) ## Task We often want to know whether a set of data is normally distributed, so that we can deduce what inference tests are appropriate to conduct. If we have a set of data and want to figure out if it comes from a population that follows a normal distribution, one tool that can help is a QQ plot. How do we make and interpret one? Related tasks: * [How to test data for normality with Pearson's chi-squared test](../how-to-test-data-for-normality-with-pearson-s-chi-squared-test) * [How to test data for normality with the D'Agostino-Pearson test](../how-to-test-data-for-normality-with-the-d-agostino-pearson-test) * [How to test data for normality with the Jarque-Bera test](../how-to-test-data-for-normality-with-the-jarque-bera-test) ## Solution We're going to use some fake data here by generating random numbers, but you can replace our fake data with your real data in the code below. ```python # Replace this with your data, such as a variable or column in a DataFrame import numpy as np values = np.random.normal(0, 1, 50) # 50 random values ``` If the data

) Our observed values fall pretty close to the reference line. In this case, we expected that, because we created fake data that was normally distributed. But for real data, it may not stay so close to the red line. Content last modified on 14 September 2021.

If we have a set of data and want to figure out if it comes from a population that follows a normal distribution, one tool that can help is a QQ plot. How do we make and interpret one?

    "content": "# How to create basic plots (in Python, using Matplotlib) [See all solutions.](../how-to-create-basic-plots) ## Task Plotting is a huge topic with many options and variations, but the most foundational types of plots are a line plot and a scatterplot. How can we create those? Related topics: * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to create bivariate plots to compare groups](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution We will create some fake data using Python lists, for simplicity. But everything we show below works also if your data is in columns of a DataFrame, such as `df['age']`. ```python patient_id = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] patient_height = [ 60, 64, 64, 65, 66, 66, 70, 72, 72, 76 ] patient_weight = [ 141, 182, 169, 204, 138, 198, 180, 175, 244, 196 ] ``` The conventional way to import matplotlib in Python is as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` Make a line plot by giving the $x$ and $y$​ data values in separate lists (or in this case pandas Series).

    "content": "# How to create bivariate plots to compare groups (in Python, using Matplotlib and Seaborn) [See all solutions.](../how-to-create-bivariate-plots-to-compare-groups) ## Task Suppose we have a dataset with different treatment conditions and an outcome variable, and we want to perform exploratory data analysis. How would we visually compare the treatment conditions with regards to the outcome variable? Related tasks: * [How to create basic plots](../how-to-create-basic-plots) * [How to add details to a plot](../how-to-add-details-to-a-plot) * [How to create a histogram](../how-to-create-a-histogram) * [How to create a box (and whisker) plot](../how-to-create-a-box-and-whisker-plot) * [How to change axes, ticks, and scale in a plot](../how-to-change-axes-ticks-and-scale-in-a-plot) * [How to plot interaction effects of treatments](../how-to-plot-interaction-effects-of-treatments) ## Solution The solution below uses an example dataset about the teeth of 10 guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels (in mg) with two delivery methods (orange juice vs. ascorbic acid). (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('ToothGrowth') ``` If you wish to understand the distribution of a numeric variable (here \"len\") compared across different values of a categorical variable (here \"supp\"), you can construct a bivariate histogram. We use Seaborn and Matplotlib to do so. ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt sns.displot(df, x=\"len\", col=\"supp\", stat=\"density\") plt.show() ```

This is called a goodness of fit test for a multinomial experiment. How can we execute it? ## Solution Let's say we have a dataset with the previous population proportions for four categories. (This is contrived data, but the code below can be used on your actual data.) | Category | Frequency |Proportion |----------|-----------|------------| A | 43 | 0.25 | B | 62 | 0.36 | C | 52 | 0.30 | D | 16 | 0.09 | We have also taken a more recent sample and found the number of observations from it that belong to each category. We want to determine if the proportions coming from the recent sample are equal to the previous proportions. SciPy expects that we will have two lists, one with the expected number of observations in each group (from the previous, or hypothesized proportions) and the other with the actual number of observations in each group (from the more recent sample). SciPy also expects that the total number of observations in each list is the same. We'll create two lists below with the fake data from above, but you can replace them with your real data ```python # Replace your data in the next two lines old_observations = [43, 62, 52, 16] new_observations = [56, 80, 12, 25] ``` We set the null hypothesis to be that the proportions of each category from the recent sample are equal to the previous proportions $$H_0: p_A = 0.25\\text{ and }\\ p_B = 0.36\\text{ and }\\ p_C = 0.30\\text{ and }\\ p_D=0.09.$$ We choose a value $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$ as our Type 1 error rate. We'll let $\\alpha$ be 0.05 here. ```python # Run the Chi-square test, giving the test statistic and p-value from scipy import stats stats.chisquare(f_obs=new_observations, f_exp=old_observations) ``` Power_divergenceResult(statistic=44.98776977898321, pvalue=9.30824439694332e-10) Our $p$-value is less than $\\alpha$, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

We're going to use fake fata here, but you can replace our fake data with your real data below. Because the data are matched pairs, the samples must be the same size. ```python # Replace the following example data with your real data sample1 = [15, 10, 7, 22, 17, 14] sample2 = [ 9, 1, 11, 13, 3, 6] ``` ### Two-tailed test In a two-sided hypothesis test, the null hypothesis states that the mean difference is equal to 0 (or some other hypothesized value), $H_0: \\mu_D = 0$. ```python from scipy import stats stats.ttest_rel(sample1, sample2, alternative = \"two-sided\") ``` Ttest_relResult(statistic=2.8577380332470415, pvalue=0.03550038112896236) Our $p$-value, 0.0355, is smaller than $\\alpha$, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean difference between the two samples is significantly different from zero. Note that the function above specifically tests whether the mean of $x_i-x'_i$ is zero. If we want instead to test whether it is some other value $d\\neq0$, then that's equivalent to testing whether the mean of $(x_i-d)-x'_i$ is zero. We could do so with the code below, which uses an example value of $d$. The null hypothesis is now $H_0: \\mu_D=d$. ```python d = 6 # as an example stats.ttest_rel([ x - d for x in sample1 ], sample2, alternative = \"two-sided\") ``` Ttest_relResult(statistic=0.4082482904638631, pvalue=0.6999865427788738) The above $p$-value is greater than $\\alpha=0.05$, so we could not conclude that the mean difference is significantly different from our chosen $d=6$. ### Right-tailed test If instead we want to test whether the mean difference is less than or equal to zero, $H_0: \\mu_D\\le0$, we can use a right-tailed test, as follows. ```python stats.ttest_rel(sample1, sample2, alternative = \"greater\") ``` Ttest_relResult(statistic=2.8577380332470415, pvalue=0.01775019056448118) Our $p$-value, 0.01775, is smaller than $\\alpha$, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean difference between the two samples is significantly greater than zero. A similar change could be made to the code above to test $H_0:\\mu_D\\le d$, as in the example code further above that uses $d=6$. ### Left-tailed test If instead we want to test whether the mean difference is greater than or equal to zero, $H_0: \\mu_D\\ge 0$, we can use a right-tailed test, as follows. ```python stats.ttest_rel(sample1, sample2, alternative = \"less\") ``` Ttest_relResult(statistic=2.8577380332470415, pvalue=0.9822498094355188) Our $p$-value, 0.98225, is larger than $\\alpha$, so we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis; we must continue to assume that the mean difference between the two samples is greater than or equal to zero. A similar change could be made to the code above to test $H_0:\\mu_D\\ge d$, as in the example code further above that uses $d=6$. Content last modified on 07 December 2021. See a problem?

That is, the proportion (between 0.0 and 1.0) of the population that is in a certain category with respect to the qualitative variables. Given a sample proportion, $\\bar{p}$, how can we test whether the population proportion is equal to, greater than, or less than some hypothesized value?

Let's say that we've hypothesized that about one-third of Bostonians are unhappy with the Red Sox' performance. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed 460 Bostonians and found that 76 of them were unhappy with the Red Sox' performance. We summarize this situation with the following variables. We will do a test with a Type I error rate of $\\alpha=0.05$. ```python n = 460 # Number of respondents in sample x = 76 # Number of respondents in chosen subset sample_prop = x/n # Proportion of sample in chosen subset population_prop = 1/3 # Hypothesized population proportion ``` ### Two-tailed test A two-tailed test is for the null hypothesis $H_0: p = \\frac13$. It can be done by directly computing the test statistic and $p$-value using tools from SciPy's `stats` module. ```python import numpy as np from scipy import stats test_stat = ( (sample_prop - population_prop) / np.sqrt(population_prop*(1 - population_prop)/n) ) stats.norm.sf(abs(test_stat))*2 # p-value ``` 2.0284218907806657e-14 The $p$-value is less than $\\alpha$, so we can reject the null hypothesis. The proportion of Bostonians unhappy with Red Sox performance is different from $\\frac13$. ### Right-tailed test A right-tailed test is for the null hypothesis $H_0: p \\le \\frac13$. Most of the code is the same as above, but the $p$-value is computed differently for a one-sided test. We repeat the re-used code to make it easy to copy and paste. ```python import numpy as np from scipy import stats test_stat = ( (sample_prop - population_prop) / np.sqrt(population_prop*(1 - population_prop)/n) ) stats.norm.sf(test_stat) ``` 0.9999999999999899 The $p$-value is greater than $\\alpha$, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis. We continue to assume that the proportion of Bostonians unhappy with Red Sox performance is less than or equal to $\\frac13$. ### Left-tailed test A left-tailed test is for the null hypothesis $H_0: p\\ge \\frac13$. Most of the code is the same as above, but the $p$-value is computed differently yet again. We repeat the re-used code to make it easy to copy and paste. ```python import numpy as np from scipy import stats test_stat = ( (sample_prop - population_prop) / np.sqrt(population_prop*(1 - population_prop)/n) ) stats.norm.sf(abs(test_stat)) ``` 1.0142109453903328e-14 The $p$-value is less than $\\alpha$, so we can reject the null hypothesis.

You will need not only the samples but also the known population standard deviations. ```python sample1 = [ 5, 8, 10, 3, 6, 2] sample2 = [13, 20, 16, 12, 18, 15] population1_sd = 2.4 population2_sd = 3 ``` We must compute the sizes and means of the two samples. ```python import numpy as np n1 = len(sample1) n2 = len(sample2) sample1_mean = np.mean(sample1) sample2_mean = np.mean(sample2) ``` We choose a value $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$ as the probability of a Type I error (a false positive, finding we should reject $H_0$ when it’s actually true). We will use $\\alpha=0.05$ in this example. ### Two-tailed test In a two-tailed test, the null hypothesis is that the difference is zero, $H_0: \\bar{x} - \\bar{x}' = 0$. We compute a test statistic and $p$-value as follows. ```python from scipy import stats test_statistic = ( (sample1_mean - sample2_mean) / np.sqrt(population1_sd**2/n1 + population2_sd**2/n2) ) 2*stats.norm.sf(abs(test_statistic)) # two-tailed p-value ``` 1.8204936819059392e-10 Our p-value is less than $\\alpha$, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The difference between the means is significantly different from zero. ### Right-tailed test In the right-tailed test, the null hypothesis is $H_0: \\bar{x} - \\bar{x}' \\le 0$. That is, we are testing whether the difference is greater than zero. The code is very similar to the previous, except only in computing the $p$-value. We repeat the code that's in common, to make it easier to copy and paste the examples. ```python from scipy import stats test_statistic = ( (sample1_mean - sample2_mean) / np.sqrt(population1_sd**2/n1 + population2_sd**2/n2) ) stats.norm.sf(test_statistic) # right-tailed p-value ``` 0.9999999999089754 Our $p$-value is greater than $\\alpha$, so we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We would continue to assume that the difference in means is less than or equal to zero. ### Left-tailed test In a left-tailed test, the null hypothesis is $H_0: \\bar{x} - \\bar{x}' \\ge 0$. That is, we are testing whether the difference is less than zero. The code is very similar to the previous, except only in computing the $p$-value. We repeat the code that's in common, to make it easier to copy and paste the examples. ```python from scipy import stats test_statistic = ( (sample1_mean - sample2_mean) / np.sqrt(population1_sd**2/n1 + population2_sd**2/n2) ) stats.norm.sf(-test_statistic) # left-tailed p-value ``` 9.102468409529696e-11 Our $p$-value is less than $\\alpha$, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Imagine we conduct a survey of people in Boston and of people in Nashville and ask them if they prefer chocolate or vanilla ice cream. We get data like the following. | City | Prefer chocolate | Prefer vanilla | Total |-----------|------------------|----------------|-------| Boston | 60 | 90 | 150 | Nashville | 85 | 50 | 135 | We want to compare the proportions of people from the two cities who like vanilla. Let $\\bar{p}_1$ represent the proportion of people from Boston who like vanilla and $\\bar{p}_2$ represent the proportion of people from Nashville who like vanilla. ```python n1 = 150 # number of observations in sample 1 n2 = 135 # number of observations in sample 2 p_bar1 = 90/150 # proportion in sample 1 p_bar2 = 50/135 # proportion in sample 2 ``` We choose a value $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$ as our Type 1 error rate. For this example, we will use $\\alpha=0.05$. ### Two-tailed test In a two-tailed test, the null hypothesis states that the difference between the two proportions equals a hypothesized value; let's choose zero, $H_0: \\bar{p}_1 - \\bar{p}_2 = 0$. We perform this test by computing a test statistic and $p$-value as shown below, then comparing the $p$-value to our chosen $\\alpha$. ```python import numpy as np p_bar = (90 + 50) / (150 + 135) # overall proportion std_error = np.sqrt(p_bar*(1-p_bar)*(1/n1+1/n2)) # standard error test_statistic = (p_bar1 - p_bar2)/std_error # test statistic from scipy import stats 2*stats.norm.sf(abs(test_statistic)) # two-tailed p-value ``` 0.00010802693662804402 Our $p$-value, 0.000108, is smaller than $\\alpha$, so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference between the two proportions is different from zero. But we did not need to compare the difference to zero; we could have used any hypothesized difference for comparison. Let's repeat the above test, comparing the difference to $0.15$ instead, as an example. ```python import numpy as np hyp_diff = 0.15 # hypothesized difference std_error = np.sqrt(p_bar1*(1-p_bar1)/n1 + p_bar2*(1-p_bar2)/n2) # standard error test_statistic = ((p_bar1 - p_bar2) - hyp_diff)/std_error # test statistic from scipy import stats 2*stats.norm.sf(abs(test_statistic)) # two-tailed p-value ``` 0.16744531573658772 Our $p$-value, 0.1674, is greater than $\\alpha$, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and cannot conclude that the difference between these two proportions is significantly different from 0.15. ### Right-tailed test In a right-tailed test, the null hypothesis states that the difference between the two proportions is less than or equal to a hypothesized value. Let's begin by using zero as our hypothesized value, $H_0: \\bar{p}_1 - \\bar{p}_2 \\le 0$. We repeat some code below that we've seen above, just to make it easy to copy and paste the example elsewhere. ```python import numpy as np p_bar = (90 + 50) / (150 + 135) # overall proportion std_error = np.sqrt(p_bar*(1-p_bar)*(1/n1+1/n2)) # standard error test_statistic = (p_bar1 - p_bar2)/std_error # test statistic from scipy import stats stats.norm.sf(abs(test_statistic)) # right-tailed p-value ``` 5.401346831402201e-05 Our $p$-value is smaller than $\\alpha$, so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference between the two proportions is significantly greater than zero. But we did not need to compare the difference to zero; we could have used any hypothesized difference for comparison. Let's repeat the above test, comparing the difference to $0.15$ instead, as an example. ```python import numpy as np hyp_diff = 0.15 # hypothesized difference std_error = np.sqrt(p_bar1*(1-p_bar1)/n1 + p_bar2*(1-p_bar2)/n2) # standard error test_statistic = ((p_bar1 - p_bar2) - hyp_diff)/std_error # test statistic from scipy import stats stats.norm.sf(abs(test_statistic)) # right-tailed p-value ``` 0.08372265786829386 Our $p$-value, 0.0837, is greater than $\\alpha$, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and cannot conclude that the difference between these two proportions is significantly greater than 0.15. ### Left-tailed test In a left-tailed test, the null hypothesis states that the difference between the two proportions is greater than or equal to a hypothesized value. Let's begin by using zero as our hypothesized value, $H_0: \\bar{p}_1 - \\bar{p}_2 \\ge 0$. We repeat some code below that we've seen above, just to make it easy to copy and paste the example elsewhere. ```python import numpy as np p_bar = (90 + 50) / (150 + 135) # overall proportion std_error = np.sqrt(p_bar*(1-p_bar)*(1/n1+1/n2)) # standard error test_statistic = (p_bar1 - p_bar2)/std_error # test statistic from scipy import stats stats.norm.sf(-test_statistic) # left-tailed p-value ``` 0.999945986531686 Our $p$-value, 0.9999, is greater than $\\alpha$, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and cannot conclude that the difference between the two proportions is significantly less than zero.

We take a sample, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_k$, and compute its mean $\\bar{x}$. We want to determine if the sample mean is significantly different from, greater than, or less than some hypothesized value, such as a hypothesized population mean.

We have a sample of just 5 values and an assumed population standard deviation of 3. ```python sample = [31, 44, 28, 25, 40] # sample data pop_std = 3 # population standard deviation ``` We also choose a value $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$ as our Type I error rate. We'll let $\\alpha$ be 0.05 here, but you can change that in the code below. ### Two-tailed test In a two-tailed test, we compare the unknown population mean to a hypothesized value $m$ using the null hypothesis $H_0: \\mu=m$. Here we'll use $m=30$, but you can replace that value in the code below with the hypothesis relevant for your situation. ```python from scipy import stats import numpy as np m = 30 # hypothesized mean n = len(sample) # number of observations xbar = np.mean(sample) # sample mean test_stat = (xbar - m) / (pop_std/np.sqrt(n)) # test statistic 2*stats.norm.sf(abs(test_stat)) # two-tailed p-value ``` 0.007290358091535614 The $p$-value, 0.00729, is less than $\\alpha$, so we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the actual population mean $\\mu$ is significantly different from the hypothesized value of $m=30$. ### Right-tailed test In a right-tailed hypothesis test, the null hypothesis is that the population mean is greater than or equal to a chosen value, $H_0: \\mu \\ge m$. Most of the code below is the same as above, but we repeat it to make it easy to copy and paste. Only the computation of the $p$-value changes. ```python from scipy import stats import numpy as np m = 30 # hypothesized mean n = len(sample) # number of observations xbar = np.mean(sample) # sample mean test_stat = (xbar - m) / (pop_std/np.sqrt(n)) # test statistic stats.norm.sf(abs(test_stat)) # right-tailed p-value ``` 0.003645179045767807 The $p$-value, 0.003645, is less than $\\alpha$, so we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the actual population mean $\\mu$ is significantly less than the hypothesized value of $m=30$. ### Left-tailed test In a left-tailed hypothesis test, the null hypothesis is that the population mean is less than or equal to a chosen value, $H_0: \\mu \\le m$. Most of the code below is the same as above, but we repeat it to make it easy to copy and paste. Only the computation of the $p$-value changes. ```python from scipy import stats import numpy as np m = 30 # hypothesized mean n = len(sample) # number of observations xbar = np.mean(sample) # sample mean test_stat = (xbar - m) / (pop_std/np.sqrt(n)) # test statistic stats.norm.sf(-abs(test_stat)) # left-tailed p-value ``` 0.9963548209542322 The $p$-value, 0.99635, is greater than $\\alpha$, so wwe do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that $\\mu>m$ and should continue to accept the null hypothesis, that $\\mu\\le m$.

We take two samples of data, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_k$ from population 1 and $x'_1, x'_2, x'_3, \\ldots, x'_k$ from population 2. What hypothesis tests can help us compare the population variances?

This dataset has information on the daily closing prices of 4 European stock indices. We're going to compare the variability of Germany's DAX and France's CAC closing prices. Let's load the dataset. (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) If using your own data, place it into the `sample1` and `sample2` variables instead of using the code below. ```python from rdatasets import data import pandas as pd # Load in the EuStockMarkets data and place it in a pandas DataFrame EuStockMarkets = data('EuStockMarkets') df = pd.DataFrame(EuStockMarkets[['DAX', 'CAC']]) # Choose the two columns we want to analyze # (You can replace the two lines below with your actual data.) sample1 = df['DAX'] sample2 = df['CAC'] ``` For all tests below, we will use $\\alpha=0.05$ as our Type I Error Rate, but any value between 0.0 and 1.0 can be used. ### Two-tailed test We can use a two-tailed test to test whether the two population variances are equal. Specifically, the null hypothesis will be: $$H_0: \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{\\sigma_2^2} = 1$$ ```python from scipy import stats sample1_df = len(sample1) - 1 # degrees of freedom sample2_df = len(sample2) - 1 # degrees of freedom test_statistic = sample1.var() / sample2.var() # test statistic stats.f.sf(test_statistic, dfn = sample1_df, dfd = sample2_df)*2 # p-value ``` 7.729079251495416e-151 Our $p$-value is smaller than our chosen alpha, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The ratio of the variance of the closing prices on Germany's DAX and France's CAC is significantly different than 1, so the variances are not equal. ### Right-tailed test In a right-tailed test, the null hypothesis is that the ratio is less than or equal to 1. This is equivalent to asking if $\\sigma_1^2 \\le \\sigma_2^2$. $$H_0: \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{\\sigma_2^2} \\le 1$$ We repeat below some of the code above to make each example easy to copy and paste. ```python from scipy import stats sample1_df = len(sample1) - 1 # degrees of freedom sample2_df = len(sample2) - 1 # degrees of freedom test_statistic = sample1.var() / sample2.var() # test statistic stats.f.sf(test_statistic, dfn = sample1_df, dfd = sample2_df) # p-value ``` 3.864539625747708e-151 Our $p$-value is smaller than our chosen alpha, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The ratio of the variance of the closing prices on Germany's DAX and France's CAC is significantly greater than 1, so the variance of closing prices on Germany's DAX is greater than that of closing prices on France's CAC. To test whether $\\sigma_1^2 \\ge \\sigma_2^2$, simply swap the roles of the two data columns in the above code. Content last modified on 24 October 2021. See a problem?

We can use a two-tailed test to test whether the two population variances are equal.

Our $p$-value is smaller than our chosen alpha, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The ratio of the variance of the closing prices on Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC is significantly different than 1, so the variances are not equal. Right-tailed test . In a right-tailed test, the null hypothesis is that the ratio is less than or equal to 1. This is equivalent to asking if $\\sigma_1^2 \\le \\sigma_2^2$. \\[H_0: \\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{\\sigma_2^2} \\le 1\\] We repeat below some of the code above to make each example easy to copy and paste. | 1 2 3 4 . | sample.1.df &lt;- length(sample.1) - 1 # degrees of freedom sample.2.df &lt;- length(sample.2) - 1 # degrees of freedom test.statistic &lt;- var(sample.1)/var(sample.2) # test statistic pf(test.statistic, df1=sample.1.df, df2=sample.2.df, lower.tail=FALSE) # p-value . | . | 1 . | [1] 3.86454e-151 . | . Our $p$-value is smaller than our chosen alpha, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

We choose a value $0\\leq\\alpha\\leq1$ as the probability of a Type I error (false positive, finding we should reject $H_0$ when it's actually true). Let's use $\\alpha=0.10$ as an example. ```python from scipy import stats # Replace these first three lines with the values from your situation. sample1 = [ 6, 9, 7, 10, 10, 9 ] sample2 = [ 12, 14, 10, 17, 9 ] # Run a one-sample t-test and print out alpha, the p value, # and whether the comparison says to reject the null hypothesis. stats.ttest_ind( sample1, sample2, equal_var=False, alternative=\"less\" ) ``` Ttest_indResult(statistic=-2.4616581720814326, pvalue=0.025486418709238467) The output says that the $p$-value is about $0.0255$, which is less than $\\alpha=0.10$. Therefore the samples give us enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the $\\alpha=0.10$ level. That is, the data suggest that $\\bar x_1 < \\bar x_2$. The `equal_var` parameter tells SciPy *not* to assume that the two samples have equal variances. If in your case they do, you can omit that parameter, and it will revert to its default value of `True`. Content last modified on 07 December 2021. See a problem?

Here I'll construct some made-up data about SAT scores at four different schools. ```julia school1_SATs = [ 1100, 1250, 1390, 970, 1510 ]; school2_SATs = [ 1010, 1050, 1090, 1110 ]; school3_SATs = [ 900, 1550, 1300, 1270, 1210 ]; school4_SATs = [ 900, 850, 1110, 1070, 910, 920 ]; ``` ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal. You choose $\\alpha$, the probability of Type I error (false positive, finding we should reject $H_0$ when it's actually true). I will use $\\alpha=0.05$ in this example. ```julia using HypothesisTests alpha = 0.05 p_value = pvalue( OneWayANOVATest( school1_SATs, school2_SATs, school3_SATs, school4_SATs ) ) reject_H0 = p_value < alpha alpha, p_value, reject_H0 ``` (0.05, 0.03405326535040251, true) The result we see above is to reject $H_0$, and therefore conclude that at least one pair of means is statistically significantly different. If you are using the most common $\\alpha$ value of $0.05$, you can save a few lines of code and get a more detailed printout by just printing out the test itself: ```julia OneWayANOVATest( school1_SATs, school2_SATs, school3_SATs, school4_SATs ) ``` One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test ----------------------------------------- Population details: parameter of interest: Means value under h_0: \"all equal\" point estimate: NaN Test summary: outcome with 95% confidence: reject h_0 p-value: 0.0341 Details: number of observations: [5, 4, 5, 6] F statistic: 3.69513 degrees of freedom: (3, 16) Content last modified on 05 November 2022.

If you still need to create one, first see [how to fit a multiple linear regression model](../how-to-fit-a-multiple-linear-regression-model).

We will use a null hypothesis that states that all of the model's coefficients are equal to zero, that is, they are not jointly significant in predicting $y$. We can write $H_0: \\beta_0 = \\beta_1 = \\beta2 = \\beta_3 = 0$. We also choose a value $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$ as our Type 1 error rate. Herer we'll use $\\alpha=0.05$.

We will focus on the impact of age group (`agegp`) and alcohol consumption (`alcgp`) on the number of cases of the cancer (`ncases`). We ask, does the interaction between these two factors affect the number of cases? First, we load in the dataset. (See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data data = data('esoph') data.head() ``` | | agegp | alcgp | tobgp | ncases | ncontrols | . | 0 | 25-34 | 0-39g/day | 0-9g/day | 0 | 40 | . | 1 | 25-34 | 0-39g/day | 10-19 | 0 | 10 | . | 2 | 25-34 | 0-39g/day | 20-29 | 0 | 6 | . | 3 | 25-34 | 0-39g/day | 30+ | 0 | 5 | . | 4 | 25-34 | 40-79 | 0-9g/day | 0 | 27 | . Next, we create a model that includes the response variable we care about, plus the two categorical variables we will be testing, as well as their interaction term. ```python import statsmodels.api as sm from statsmodels.formula.api import ols # C(...) means the variable is categorical, and : means multiplication. model = ols('ncases ~ C(alcgp) + C(agegp) + C(alcgp):C(agegp)', data = data).fit() ``` A two-way ANOVA with interaction tests the following three null hypotheses. 1. There is no interaction between the two categorical variables. (If we reject this we do not test the other two hypotheses.) 2. The mean response is the same across all groups of the first factor. (In our example, that says the mean `ncases` is the same for all age groups.) 3. The mean response is the same across all groups of the second factor. (In our example, that says the mean `ncases` is the same for all alcohol consumption groups.) We choose a value, $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$, as the Type I Error Rate.

The $p$-value for the interaction of age group and alcohol consumption is in the third row, final column, $3.63271\\times10^{-2}$. It is less than $\\alpha$, so we can reject the null hypothesis that age group and alcohol consumption do not interact with regards to the number of esophageal cancer cases. That is, we have reason to believe that their interaction does effect the outcome. As we stated when we listed the hypotheses to test, since we rejected the first null hypothesis, we will not test the other two. In the case where you failed to reject the first null hypothesis, you could consider each $p$-value in the first two rows of the above table, one for each of the two factors.

Also assume that the sample sizes are small or the populations are not normally distributed, but that the two population distributions are approximately the same shape. How can we test whether there is a significant difference between the two medians (or if one is significantly greater than or less than the other)? One method is the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Related tasks: * [How to do a Kruskal-Wallis test](../how-to-do-a-kruskal-wallis-test) * [How to do a Wilcoxon signed-rank test](../how-to-do-a-wilcoxon-signed-rank-test) * [How to do a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched pairs](../how-to-do-a-wilcoxon-signed-rank-test-for-matched-pairs) ## Solution We're going to use fake data for illustrative purposes, but you can replace our fake data with your real data. Say our first sample, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots x_n$, has median $m_1$, and our second sample, $x'_1, x'_2, x'_3, \\ldots x'_m$, has median $m_2$. ```python import numpy as np # Replace sample1 and sample2 with your data sample1 = np.array([56, 31, 190, 176, 119, 15, 140, 152, 167]) sample2 = np.array([45, 36, 78, 54, 12, 25, 39, 48, 52, 70, 85]) ``` We choose a value, $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$, as the Type I Error Rate. We'll let $\\alpha$ be 0.05. ### Two-tailed test To test the null hypothesis $H_0: m_1 - m_2 = 0$, that is, $m_1=m_2$, we use a two-tailed test: ```python from scipy import stats from scipy.stats import ranksums ranksums(sample1, sample2) ``` RanksumsResult(statistic=2.0892772350933626, pvalue=0.03668277440246522) Our p-value, $0.03668$, is less than $\\alpha=0.05$, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The population medians are significantly different from each other. (The output above is slightly different from the output you would get by running this test in R, because SciPy uses a normal distribution internally, but R uses a Wilcoxon distribution.) ### Right-tailed test To test the null hypothesis $H_0: m_1 - m_2 \\le 0$, that is, $m_1\\le m_2$, we use a right-tailed test: ```python ranksums(sample1, sample2, alternative = 'greater') ``` RanksumsResult(statistic=2.0892772350933626, pvalue=0.01834138720123261) Our p-value, $0.01834$, is less than $\\alpha=0.05$, so we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The first population medians is significantly greater second. (The output above is slightly different from the output you would get by running this test in R, because SciPy uses a normal distribution internally, but R uses a Wilcoxon distribution.) ### Left-tailed test To test the null hypothesis $H_0: m_1 - m_2 \\ge 0$, that is, $m_1\\ge m_2$, we use a left-tailed test: ```python ranksums(sample1, sample2, alternative = 'less') ``` RanksumsResult(statistic=2.0892772350933626, pvalue=0.9816586127987674) Our p-value, $0.98165$, is greater than $\\alpha$, so we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Say our sample, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots x_k$, has median $m$. ```python import numpy as np # Replace the next line with your data sample = np.array([19, 4, 23, 16, 1, 8, 30, 25, 13]) ``` We choose a value, $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$, as the Type I Error Rate.

Can we find critical points for a multivariate function using software? Related tasks: * [How to find the critical numbers of a function](../how-to-find-the-critical-numbers-of-a-function) (single-variable version) ## Solution This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output ``` Let's create an example function to work with. ```python var( 'x y' ) formula = x**3 + x*y - 3*y**2 formula ``` $\\\\displaystyle x^{3} + x y - 3 y^{2}$ Critical numbers come in two kinds. First, where are all partial derivatives zero? Second, where is a derivative undefined but the function is defined? Let's begin by finding where both partial derivatives are zero. Recall that a common notation for the partial derivatives is $f_x$ and $f_y$. We'll use the same techniques introduced in [how to write symbolic equations](../how-to-write-symbolic-equations) and [how to solve symbolic equations](../how-to-solve-symbolic-equations). ```python f_x = diff( formula, x ) f_y = diff( formula, y ) f_x, f_y ``` $\\\\displaystyle \\\\left( 3 x^{2} + y, \\\\ x - 6 y\\\\right)$ We can set both equal to zero and solve those equations simultaneously as follows. In other words, SymPy will solve $3x^2+y=0$ and $x-6y=0$ simultaneously for us. ```python solve( [ f_x, f_y ] ) # that is, f_x=0 and f_y=0 ``` $\\\\displaystyle \\\\left[ \\\\left\\\\{ x : - \\\\frac{1}{18}, \\\\ y : - \\\\frac{1}{108}\\\\right\\\\}, \\\\ \\\\left\\\\{ x : 0, \\\\ y : 0\\\\right\\\\}\\\\right]$ That output indicates two critical numbers, one at $\\left(-\\frac{1}{18},-\\frac{1}{108}\\right)$ and one at $(0,0)$. Now where is the derivative defined but the function undefined? Unfortunately, SymPy cannot help us compute the domain of multivariate functions. You will need to do that yourself. (In this case, the function is defined for all real values of $x$ and $y$.) But SymPy can help us classify the two critical numbers above. Are they maxima, minima, or saddle points? We use the discriminant, built from the second partial derivatives, $D=f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2$. ```python f_xx = diff( formula, x, x ) f_yy = diff( formula, y, y ) f_xy = diff( formula, x, y ) D = f_xx*f_yy - f_xy**2 D ``` $\\\\displaystyle - 36 x - 1$ We can then evaluate the discriminant on our critical points. Recall the following rules from multivariate calculus: * If $D0$ and $f_xx0$ and $f_xx>0$ then the critical point is a minimum. Let's begin by checking $\\left(-\\frac{1}{18},-\\frac{1}{108}\\right)$. ```python D.subs( x, -1/18 ).subs( y, -1/108 ) ``` $\\\\displaystyle 1.0$ Since $D>0$ we must check $f_{xx}$. ```python f_xx.subs( x, -1/18 ).subs( y, -1/108 ) ``` $\\\\displaystyle -0.333333333333333$ Because $f_{xx}<0$, the point $\\left(-\\frac{1}{18},-\\frac{1}{108}\\right)$ is a maximum. Now we check $(0,0)$. ```python D.subs( x, 0 ).subs( y, 0 ) ``` $\\\\displaystyle -1$ Because $D<0$, the point $(0,0)$ is a saddle point. Content last modified on 27 January 2023. See a problem?

    "content": "View this solution alone. This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. | 1 2 . | from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output . | . Let’s create an example function to work with. | 1 2 3 . | var( 'x y' ) formula = x**3 + x*y - 3*y**2 formula . | . $\\displaystyle x^{3} + x y - 3 y^{2}$ . Critical numbers come in two kinds. First, where are all partial derivatives zero? Second, where is a derivative undefined but the function is defined? . Let’s begin by finding where both partial derivatives are zero. Recall that a common notation for the partial derivatives is $f_x$ and $f_y$. We’ll use the same techniques introduced in how to write symbolic equations and how to solve symbolic equations. | 1 2 3 . | f_x = diff( formula, x ) f_y = diff( formula, y ) f_x, f_y . | . $\\displaystyle \\left( 3 x^{2} + y, \\ x - 6 y\\right)$ . We can set both equal to zero and solve those equations simultaneously as follows. In other words, SymPy will solve $3x^2+y=0$ and $x-6y=0$ simultaneously for us. | 1 . | solve( [ f_x, f_y ] ) # that is, f_x=0 and f_y=0 . | . $\\displaystyle \\left[ \\left\\{ x : - \\frac{1}{18}, \\ y : - \\frac{1}{108}\\right\\}, \\ \\left\\{ x : 0, \\ y : 0\\right\\}\\right]$ . That output indicates two critical numbers, one at $\\left(-\\frac{1}{18},-\\frac{1}{108}\\right)$ and one at $(0,0)$. Now where is the derivative defined but the function undefined? Unfortunately, SymPy cannot help us compute the domain of multivariate functions. You will need to do that yourself. (In this case, the function is defined for all real values of $x$ and $y$.) . But SymPy can help us classify the two critical numbers above. Are they maxima, minima, or saddle points? We use the discriminant, built from the second partial derivatives, $D=f_{xx}f_{yy}-f_{xy}^2$. | 1 2 3 4 5 . | f_xx = diff( formula, x, x ) f_yy = diff( formula, y, y ) f_xy = diff( formula, x, y ) D = f_xx*f_yy - f_xy**2 D . | . $\\displaystyle - 36 x - 1$ . We can then evaluate the discriminant on our critical points. Recall the following rules from multivariate calculus: . | If $D&lt;0$ then the critical point is a saddle point. | If $D&gt;0$ and $f_xx&lt;0$ then the critical point is a maximum. | If $D&gt;0$ and $f_xx&gt;0$ then the critical point is a minimum. | . Let’s begin by checking $\\left(-\\frac{1}{18},-\\frac{1}{108}\\right)$. | 1 . | D.subs( x, -1/18 ).subs( y, -1/108 ) . | . $\\displaystyle 1.0$ . Since $D&gt;0$ we must check $f_{xx}$. | 1 . | f_xx.subs( x, -1/18 ).subs( y, -1/108 ) . | . $\\displaystyle -0.333333333333333$ . Because $f_{xx}&lt;0$, the point $\\left(-\\frac{1}{18},-\\frac{1}{108}\\right)$ is a maximum. Now we check $(0,0)$. | 1 . | D.subs( x, 0 ).subs( y, 0 ) . | . $\\displaystyle -1$ .

How can we get access to them in software, to generate random values from a chosen distribution? Related tasks: * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot continuous probability distributions](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions) * [How to plot discrete probability distributions](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions) ## Solution You can generate random numbers from many common distributions easily using the Data Analysis Toolpak. (Below we cover another method that does not use the Data Analysis Toolpak.) If you’ve never enabled it before, see [these instructions from Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/load-the-analysis-toolpak-in-excel-6a63e598-cd6d-42e3-9317-6b40ba1a66b4#OfficeVersion=Windows) on how to do so. On the Data tab, click the Data Analysis button, shown below. From the list of tools it provides, choose Random Number Generation, as shown below, then click OK. Choose a number of variables (that is, columns of output) and of random numbers (that is, rows of output) and a distribution. Once you select a distribution, you can also select its parameters (e.g., the mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution). Choose where you want the output and then click OK. Here is example data generated for 3 variables, 20 random numbers per variable, using a standard normal distribution. It’s also possible to generate random numbers using Excel formulas in place of the Data Analysis Toolpak. Here’s how: No matter what distribution you want to draw from, *begin by generating random values from the uniform distribution on the interval \\[0,1\\]* using the =RAND() function. For example, if you’ll want 10 random values, place the =RAND() formula into 10 cells in a single column, like so: Then in an adjacent column, apply one of the built-in inverse CDF functions from Excel’s statistics function set. For example, to generate values from a normal distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 2, apply =NORM.INV(\\_,5,2) to each random number in the first column. The NORM.INV function converts uniform random values into random values chosen from the specified distribution. Excel also has built-in functions for several other distributions, including BETA.INV, BINOM.INV, CHISQ.INV, F.INV, GAMMA.INV, LOGNORM.INV, and T.INV. Excel recomputes random values every time a formula or cell changes. If you do not want this behavior, simply copy all the random cells and then paste them back into the exact same locations, but using the “Paste Values” functionality of Excel, which removes the original formulas, leaving only their final results.

    "content": "# How to graph curves that are not functions (in Python, using SymPy) [See all solutions.](../how-to-graph-curves-that-are-not-functions) ## Task Assume we have an equation in which $y$ cannot be isolated as a function of $x$. (The standard example is the formula for the unit circle, $x^2+y^2=1$.) We would still like to be able to use software to plot such curves. How? Related tasks: * [How to graph mathematical functions](../how-to-graph-mathematical-functions) * [How to do implicit differentiation](../how-to-do-implicit-differentiation) ## Solution This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output ``` Let's consider the example of the unit circle, $x^2+y^2=1$. To plot it, SymPy first expects us to move everything to the left-hand side of the equation, so in this case, we would have $x^2+y^2-1=0$. We then use that left hand side to represent the equation as a single formula, and we can plot it with SymPy's `plot_implicit` function. ```python var( 'x y' ) formula = x**2 + y**2 - 1 # to represent

    "content": "# How to graph mathematical functions (in Python, using NumPy and Matplotlib) [See all solutions.](../how-to-graph-mathematical-functions) ## Task Assume we have a mathematical formula and we would like to plot a graph of it using the standard Cartesian coordinate system. Related tasks: * [How to graph curves that are not functions](../how-to-graph-curves-that-are-not-functions) * [How to graph mathematical sequences](../how-to-graph-mathematical-sequences) * [How to graph a two-variable function as a surface](../how-to-graph-a-two-variable-function-as-a-surface) ## Solution Let's assume we want to graph the function $x^2-5x+9$ from $x=-10$ to $x=10$. Let's import NumPy for the mathematics and Matplotlib for the graph. ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ``` We compute a series of $(x,y)$ pairs to generate the plot. Notice how NumPy automatically computes a $y$ value for each $x$ value if we just include all the $x$s in the formula we wish to graph. ```python xs = np.linspace( -10, 10, 100 ) # 100 values from x=-10 to x=10 ys = xs**2 - 5*xs + 9 # compute all corresponding ys plt.plot( xs, ys ) plt.show() ```

Related tasks: * [How to graph curves that are not functions](../how-to-graph-curves-that-are-not-functions) * [How to graph mathematical sequences](../how-to-graph-mathematical-sequences) * [How to graph a two-variable function as a surface](../how-to-graph-a-two-variable-function-as-a-surface) ## Solution This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * #

) If you want to elimiate the extra bit of text after the graph, just assign the plot to a variable, as in `p = plot( formula )`.

One way to do so is with Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences (HSD) method. It creates confidence intervals for each pair of samples, while controlling for Type I error rate across all pairs. Thus the resulting intervals are a little wider than those produced using Fisher's LSD method. How do we make these confidence intervals, with an appropriate visualization? ## Solution We load here the same data that appears in the solution for [how to perform pairwise comparisons](../how-to-perform-pairwise-comparisons). That solution used ANOVA to determine which pairs of groups have significant differences in their means; follow its link for more details. ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('InsectSprays') df ``` | | count | spray | . | 0 | 10 | A | . | 1 | 7 | A | . | 2 | 20 | A | . | 3 | 14 | A | . | 4 | 14 | A | . | ... | ... | ... | . | 67 | 10 | F | . | 68 | 26 | F | . | 69 | 26 | F | . | 70 | 24 | F | . | 71 | 13 | F | . 72 rows × 2 columns . We now want to perform an unplanned comparison test on the data to determine the magnitudes of the differences between pairs of groups. We do this by applying Tukey's HSD approach to perform pairwise comparisons and generate confidence intervals that maintain a specified experiment-wide error rate. Before that, the `pairwise_tukeyhsd` module needs to be imported from the `statsmodels` package. ```python from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog=df['count'], groups=df['spray'], alpha=0.05) print(tukey) ``` Multiple Comparison of Means - Tukey HSD, FWER=0.05 ===================================================== group1 group2 meandiff p-adj lower upper reject ----------------------------------------------------- A B 0.8333 0.9 -3.8659 5.5326 False A C -12.4167 0.001 -17.1159 -7.7174 True A D -9.5833 0.001 -14.2826 -4.8841 True A E -11.0 0.001 -15.6992 -6.3008 True A F 2.1667 0.728 -2.5326 6.8659 False B C -13.25 0.001 -17.9492 -8.5508 True B D -10.4167 0.001 -15.1159 -5.7174 True B E -11.8333 0.001 -16.5326 -7.1341 True B F 1.3333 0.9 -3.3659 6.0326 False C D 2.8333 0.4921 -1.8659 7.5326 False C E 1.4167 0.9 -3.2826 6.1159 False C F 14.5833 0.001 9.8841 19.2826 True D E -1.4167 0.9 -6.1159 3.2826 False D F 11.75 0.001 7.0508 16.4492 True E F 13.1667 0.001 8.4674 17.8659 True ----------------------------------------------------- Because the above table contains a lot of information, it's often helpful to visualize these intervals. Python's `statsmodels` package does not have a built-in way to do so, but we can create our own as follows. ```python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt rows = tukey.summary().data[1:] plt.hlines( range(len(rows)), [row[4] for row in rows], [row[5] for row in rows] ) plt.vlines( 0, -1, len( rows )-1, linestyles='dashed' ) plt.gca().set_yticks( range( len( rows ) ) ) plt.gca().set_yticklabels( [

One way to do so is with Tukey's Honestly Significant Differences (HSD) method. It creates confidence intervals for each pair of samples, while controlling for Type I error rate across all pairs. Thus the resulting intervals are a little wider than those produced using Fisher's LSD method. How do we make these confidence intervals, with an appropriate visualization? ## Solution We load here the same data that appears in the solution for how to perform pairwise comparisons. That solution used ANOVA to determine which pairs of groups have significant differences in their means; follow its link for more details. ```R # Load an inbuilt data set called InsectSprays and assign it to the variable df df <- InsectSprays head( df, 10 ) ``` count spray 1 10 A 2 7 A 3 20 A 4 14 A 5 14 A 6 12 A 7 10 A 8 23 A 9 17 A 10 20 A We now want to perform an unplanned comparison test on the data to determine the magnitudes of the differences between pairs of groups. Although R has a built-in `TukeyHSD` function, its output is not as complete as the `HSD.test` function in the agricolae package, so here we will use that latter function. We provide it the same ANOVA results that we computed in the solution to [how to perform pairwise comparisons](../how-to-perform-pairwise-comparisons). ```R # install.packages( \"agricolae\" ) # if you have not already done this library(agricolae) aov1 <- aov(count ~ spray, data = df) HSD.test(aov1, \"spray\", group=FALSE, console=TRUE) ``` Study: aov1 ~ \"spray\" HSD Test for count Mean Square Error: 15.38131 spray, means count std r Min Max A 14.500000 4.719399 12 7 23 B 15.333333 4.271115 12 7 21 C 2.083333 1.975225 12 0 7 D 4.916667 2.503028 12 2 12 E 3.500000 1.732051 12 1 6 F 16.666667 6.213378 12 9 26 Alpha: 0.05 ; DF Error: 66 Critical Value of Studentized Range: 4.150851 Comparison between treatments means difference pvalue signif.

    "content": "# How to plot continuous probability distributions (in Excel) [See all solutions.](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions) ## Task There are many famous continuous probability distributions, such as the normal and exponential distributions. How can we get access to them in software, to plot the distribution as a curve? Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot discrete probability distributions](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions) ## Solution We begin by creating the values that will be shown on the $x$-axis. These values depend not only on the distribution, but on which portion of it you wish to see. For example, for an exponential distribution, the sample space is $(0,\\infty)$, but for a standard normal distribution, it is the whole real line, and you may wish to view just $( - 5,5)$, or some other range. In the example below, we will use a Gamma distribution with $\\alpha = 5$ and $\\beta = 5$, plotted on the range $\\lbrack 0,50\\rbrack$, but the particular example doesn’t matter; you can use the procedure below for any distribution. To generate the $x$ values from 0 to 50, begin with just the first two values in the sequence, in this case 0 and 1, as shown below. Drag the small green square in the bottom right of the selection downward, to create a sequence that goes all the way up to 50. (Only the beginning of it is shown here.) If your sample spaces were a smaller range (say, just from -2 to 2), you would need to use smaller steps to get a smooth plot. For example, you might begin with -2 and -1.9 to tell Excel to take steps of size 0.1. In the adjacent column, we put the formula for the distribution, based on the $x$ values in the first column. In this example, recall that we’ll plot a Gamma distribution with $\\alpha = 5$ and $\\beta = 5$, so we use the formula shown below. The final parameter for the distribution should always be FALSE, to indicate that we are *not* asking Excel for a cumulative distribution function, but just the usual probability density function. After typing your probability density function’s formula, drag it down the column. Highlight just column B and insert a line chart from the Insert tab on the Ribbon, as shown below. This will create a chart that does not yet include your desired $x$-axis labels; rather, the horizontal axis markings will be 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. To get the correct labels on the $x$-axis, right-click the chart and choose “Select Data…” This will bring up the window shown below. Click the Edit button for the Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels and select column A. Click OK twice to return to your plot, which should then have the correct $x$-axis labels. You can then update the chart title and axis labels to be more descriptive if desired, as shown in the final result, below. Although we used the GAMMA.DIST function in Excel, you can use any of the built-in continuous probability distribution functions, such as BETA.DIST, CHISQ.DIST, F.DIST, NORM.DIST, LOGNORM.DIST, or T.DIST.

The full list of them is online [here](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/univariate/). If you don't have that package installed, first run `using Pkg` and then `Pkg.add( \"Distributions\" )` from within Julia. The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. But we can just ask Julia to show us the central 99.98% of a continuous distribution, which is almost always indistinguishable to the human eye from the entire distribution. We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is continuous. ```julia using Distributions X = Normal( 10, 5 ) # use a normal distribution with μ=10 and σ=5 xmin = quantile( X, 0.0001 ) # compute min x as the 0.0001 quantile xmax = quantile( X, 0.9999 ) # compute max x as the 0.9999 quantile xs = range( xmin, xmax, length=100 ) # create 100 x values in that range using Plots plot( xs, pdf.( X, xs ) ) # plot the shape of the distribution ``` Content last modified on 04 November 2022.

    "content": "# How to plot continuous probability distributions (in Python, using SciPy) [See all solutions.](../how-to-plot-continuous-probability-distributions) ## Task There are many famous continuous probability distributions, such as the normal and exponential distributions. How can we get access to them in software, to plot the distribution as a curve? Related tasks: * [How to generate random values from a distribution](../how-to-generate-random-values-from-a-distribution) * [How to compute probabilities from a distribution](../how-to-compute-probabilities-from-a-distribution) * [How to plot discrete probability distributions](../how-to-plot-discrete-probability-distributions) ## Solution You can import many different random variables from SciPy's `stats` module. The full list of them is online [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#continuous-distributions). The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. But we can just ask SciPy to show us the central 99.98% of a continuous distribution, which is almost always indistinguishable to the human eye from the entire distribution. We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is continuous. ```python from scipy import stats X = stats.norm( 10, 5 ) # use a normal distribution with μ=10 and σ=5 xmin = X.ppf( 0.0001 ) # compute min x as the 0.0001 quantile xmax = X.ppf( 0.9999 ) # compute max x as the 0.9999 quantile import numpy as np xs = np.linspace( xmin, xmax, 100 ) # create 100 x values in that range import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot( xs, X.pdf( xs ) ) # plot the shape of the distribution plt.show() ```

    "content": "Because R is designed for use in statistics, it comes with many probability distributions built in. A list of them is online here. The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. But we can just ask R to show us the central 99.98% of a continuous distribution, which is almost always indistinguishable to the human eye from the entire distribution. We will use a normal distribution with $\\mu=10$ and $\\sigma=5$, but if you wanted to use a different distribution, you could replace qnorm and dnorm with, for example, qchisq and dchisq (for the $\\chi^2$ distribution), adjusting the named parameters as appropriate. (For a list of supported distributions, see the link above.) . We style the plot below so that it is clear the sample space is continuous. | 1 2 3 4 5 . | xmin &lt;- qnorm( 0.0001, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute min x as the 0.0001 quantile xmax &lt;- qnorm( 0.9999, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute max x as the 0.9999 quantile xs &lt;- seq( xmin, xmax, length.out=100 ) # create 100 values in that range ys &lt;- dnorm( xs, mean=10, sd=5 ) # compute the shape of the distribution plot( xs, ys, type='l' ) # plot that shape as a smooth line . | .

These values depend not only on the distribution, but on which portion of it you wish to see. For example, for an exponential distribution, the sample space is $(0,\\infty)$, but for a standard normal distribution, it is the whole real line, and you may wish to view just $( - 5,5)$, or some other range. In the example below, we will use a Gamma distribution with $\\alpha = 5$ and $\\beta = 5$, plotted on the range $\\lbrack 0,50\\rbrack$, but the particular example doesn’t matter; you can use the procedure below for any distribution. To generate the $x$ values from 0 to 50, begin with just the first two values in the sequence, in this case 0 and 1, as shown below. Drag the small green square in the bottom right of the selection downward, to create a sequence that goes all the way up to 50. (Only the beginning of it is shown here.) . If your sample spaces were a smaller range (say, just from -2 to 2), you would need to use smaller steps to get a smooth plot. For example, you might begin with -2 and -1.9 to tell Excel to take steps of size 0.1. In the adjacent column, we put the formula for the distribution, based on the $x$ values in the first column. In this example, recall that we’ll plot a Gamma distribution with $\\alpha = 5$ and $\\beta = 5$, so we use the formula shown below. The final parameter for the distribution should always be FALSE, to indicate that we are not asking Excel for a cumulative distribution function, but just the usual probability density function. After typing your probability density function’s formula, drag it down the column. Highlight just column B and insert a line chart from the Insert tab on the Ribbon, as shown below. This will create a chart that does not yet include your desired $x$-axis labels; rather, the horizontal axis markings will be 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. To get the correct labels on the $x$-axis, right-click the chart and choose “Select Data…” This will bring up the window shown below. Click the Edit button for the Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels and select column A. Click OK twice to return to your plot, which should then have the correct $x$-axis labels. You can then update the chart title and axis labels to be more descriptive if desired, as shown in the final result, below. Although we used the GAMMA.DIST function in Excel, you can use any of the built-in continuous probability distribution functions, such as BETA.DIST, CHISQ.DIST, F.DIST, NORM.DIST, LOGNORM.DIST, or T.DIST.

    "content": "Because R is designed for use in statistics, it comes with many probability distributions built in. A list of them is online here. The challenge with plotting a random variable is knowing the appropriate sample space, because some random variables have sample spaces of infinite width, which cannot be plotted. The example below uses a geometric distribution (with $p=0.5$), whose sample space is ${0,1,2,3,\\ldots}$. We specify that we just want to use $x$ values in the set ${0,1,2,\\ldots,10}$.

(See [how to quickly load some sample data](../how-to-quickly-load-some-sample-data).) ```python from rdatasets import data df = data('ToothGrowth') ``` To plot the interaction effects among tooth length, supplement, and dosage, we can use the `pointplot` function in the Seaborn package. ```python import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

To compute descriptive statistics, you will need the Data Analysis Toolpak.

On the Data tab, click the Data Analysis button, shown below. From the list of tools it provides, choose Descriptive Statistics, as shown below, then click OK. Highlight all the cells in your column as input (excluding the column header, if any), then check the “Summary statistics” checkbox, as shown below. Then click OK. Excel will create a new sheet that reports your column’s mean, median, variance, and more, as shown below. To get a report of the unique values in your column and the frequency of each, you can use a pivot table. Highlight your column of data, then on the Insert tab, choose Pivot Table, as shown below. Drag your column’s name from the list of pivot table fields down into both the Rows and Values areas, as shown below. From the drop-down under Values, choose “Value field settings…” and change Sum to Count, as shown below. Then click OK. Your pivot table will now contain the desired report.

We can use the `jarque_bera()` function in SciPy's stats package to run the hypothesis test. ```python from scipy import stats stats.jarque_bera( spending ) ``` Jarque_beraResult(statistic=1.3347292970972013, pvalue=0.5130588882194845) Our $p$-value of about $0.5131$ is greater than $\\alpha$, so we fail to reject our null hypothesis.

The top-right value in the output is the $p$-value for the test, $0.034$. Because it is below our chosen significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$, there are significant differences between the mean number of transactions at the ice cream shop across at least two of these weekend days. But specifically which two, or is it more than two? . We’ll use the PostHocTest() function in the DescTools package, and specify that we want to use the Bonferroni method to make the confidence intervals for each pair of days. Let’s let $\\alpha$ be equal to 0.05 again, but the Bonferroni correction implies that the overall probability of a Type I Error in any of the tests below is now at most 0.05, rather than each one being 0.05 separately. | 1 2 3 4 5 . | # install.packages(\"DescTools\") # If you have not already installed it library(DescTools) # Run the test and print the confidence intervals for each pair of days PostHocTest(model, method = \"bonferroni\", conf.level = 0.95) . | . | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 . | Posthoc multiple comparisons of means : Bonferroni 95% family-wise confidence level $days diff lwr.ci upr.ci pval Sat-Fri 18.633333 -6.108523 43.37519 0.1798 Sun-Fri 24.666667 1.076232 48.25710 0.0392 * Sun-Sat 6.033333 -18.708523 30.77519 1.0000 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 . | . In the output, R has highlighted the second row for us by placing a * after it. That is the one row where the $p$-value (in the final column) is below our chosen $\\alpha=0.05$.

    "content": "View this solution alone. Let’s assume that you have already done an analysis of variance (ANOVA). (See how to do a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for details.) . As an example, we will use the fake data below, which looks at the number of transactions at an ice cream shop on the weekends. Let’s assume that we chose $\\alpha$ to be 0.05 in that ANOVA. | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . | # Store our fake data in vectors.

The top-right value in the output is the $p$-value for the test, $0.034$. Because it is below our chosen significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$, there are significant differences between the mean number of transactions at the ice cream shop across at least two of these weekend days. But specifically which two, or is it more than two? . We’ll use the PostHocTest() function in the DescTools package, and specify that we want to use the Bonferroni method to make the confidence intervals for each pair of days. Let’s let $\\alpha$ be equal to 0.05 again, but the Bonferroni correction implies that the overall probability of a Type I Error in any of the tests below is now at most 0.05, rather than each one being 0.05 separately. | 1 2 3 4 5 . | # install.packages(\"DescTools\") # If you have not already installed it library(DescTools) # Run the test and print the confidence intervals for each pair of days PostHocTest(model, method = \"bonferroni\", conf.level = 0.95) . | . | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 . | Posthoc multiple comparisons of means : Bonferroni 95% family-wise confidence level $days diff lwr.ci upr.ci pval Sat-Fri 18.633333 -6.108523 43.37519 0.1798 Sun-Fri 24.666667 1.076232 48.25710 0.0392 * Sun-Sat 6.033333 -18.708523 30.77519 1.0000 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 . | . In the output, R has highlighted the second row for us by placing a * after it. That is the one row where the $p$-value (in the final column) is below our chosen $\\alpha=0.05$. Therefore, the only significant difference in mean number of transactions is between Sundays and Fridays. Notice also that the confidence interval in that row (from lwr.ci to upr.ci) does not include zero. (In that particular row, the confidence interval is $(1.076232,48.25710)$.) .

How can we write a Reimann sum using software? Related tasks: * [How to write and evaluate definite integrals](../how-to-write-and-evaluate-definite-integrals) * [How to write and evaluate indefinite integrals](../how-to-write-and-evaluate-indefinite-integrals) ## Solution This answer assumes you have imported SymPy as follows. ```python from sympy import * # load all math functions init_printing( use_latex='mathjax' ) # use pretty math output ``` In mathematics, we would write a Riemann sum approximating $\\int_a^b f(x)\\;dx$ as follows. $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^n f(a+i\\Delta x)\\cdot\\Delta x, $$ where $\\Delta x$ is defined as $\\frac{b-a}{n}$. This is easiest to understand if we break the Python code for it into several smaller parts. First, let's choose a formula we will use as $f(x)$ and the interval $[a,b]$ in question. ```python var( 'x a b i n' ) # We need all these variables, as you can see above. formula = x**2 # Let's pick f(x)=x^2 as a simple example. delta_x = (a - b) / n # Define delta x. delta_x ``` $\\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{a - b}{n}$ The input $a+i\\Delta x$ (which we will substitute into our formula $f(x)$) varies along the $x$ axis between $a$ and $b$ as $i$ counts from 1 to $n$. Each $f(a+i\\Delta x)$ is the height of a rectangle whose right edge is at $a+i\\Delta x$. ```python input = a + i*delta_x # Input i to substitute into f(x) height = formula.subs( x, input ) # Height of rectangle i area = delta_x * height # Area of rectangle i total = Sum( area, (i,1,n) ) # Total area of all rectangles, total # which is the Reimann sum. ``` $\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\left(a - b\\\\right) \\\\left(a + \\\\frac{i \\\\left(a - b\\\\right)}{n}\\\\right)^{2}}{n}$ We can actually use that formula to estimate $\\int_a^b f(x)\\;dx$ if we substitute in actual values for $a$, $b$, and $n$. Let's estimate the area from $a=1$ to $b=3$ with $n=10$ rectangles.
