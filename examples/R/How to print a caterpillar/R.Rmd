Replace the entire contents of this RMarkdown file with your solution to your
task, using alternating markdown and code cells as needed.  Obviously the
content below is just a silly example.  Try not to leave any blank code cells in
the final version.

We assume the user chooses the caterpillar length with the variable in line 1.
Feel free to change its value to the length of caterpillar you wish to see.

```{r}
caterpillar.length <- 5
paste( c( "`O", replicate( caterpillar.length, "oo") ), collapse = "," )
```
