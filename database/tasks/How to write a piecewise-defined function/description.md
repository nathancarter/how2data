In mathematics, we use the following notation for a
"piecewise-defined" function.

$$ f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2 & \text{if } x>2 \\ 1+x & \text{if } x\leq 2 \end{cases} $$

This means that for all $x$ values larger than 2, $f(x)=x^2$,
but for $x$ values less than or equal to 2, $f(x)=1+x$.

How can we express this in mathematical software?
