If we run a one-way ANOVA test and find that there is a significant difference
between population means, we might want to know which means are actually
different from each other. One way to do so is with Fisher's Least Significant
Difference Confidence Intervals, which forms a confidence interval for each
pair of samples. How do we go about making these confidence intervals?
