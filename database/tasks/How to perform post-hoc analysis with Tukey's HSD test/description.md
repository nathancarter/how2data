If we run a one-way ANOVA test and find that there is a significant difference
between population means, we might want to know which means are actually
different from each other. One way to do so is with Tukey's Honestly
Significant Differences (HSD) method. It creates confidence intervals for each
pair of samples, while controlling for Type I error rate across all pairs.
Thus the resulting intervals are a little wider than those produced using
Fisher's LSD method. How do we make these confidence intervals, with an
appropriate visualization?
