        "When analyzing data from a completely randomized single-factor design, suppose that you have performed an ANOVA and noticed that there's a significant difference between the treatment levels.  Perhaps you then explored further using the techniques in how to perform pairwise comparisons.  How can we extend that with a post-hoc analysis using Tukey's HSD test and an approrpriate visualization?\n",
