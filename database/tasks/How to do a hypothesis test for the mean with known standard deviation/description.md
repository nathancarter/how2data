Let's say we are measuring a variable over a population, and we know its standard
deviation $\sigma$ is known, and assume that the variable is normally distributed.
We take a sample, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_k$, and compute its mean $\bar{x}$.
We want to determine if the sample mean is significantly different from,
greater than, or less than some hypothesized value, such as a hypothesized
population mean.  How do we formulate an appropriate hypothesis test?
