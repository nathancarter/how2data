If we have a set of data that seems normally distributed, how can we compute a
confidence interval for the mean?  Assume we have some confidence level
already chosen, such as $\alpha=0.05$.

We will use the $t$-distribution because we have not assumed that we know
the population standard deviation, and we have not assumed anything about
our sample size.  If you know the population standard deviation
or have a large sample size (typically at least 30),
then you can use $z$-scores instead;
see how to compute a confidence interval for a population mean using z-scores.
