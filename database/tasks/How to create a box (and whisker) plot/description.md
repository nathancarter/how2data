A box plot, or a box and whisker plot, shows the quartiles of a single variable from a dataset (one of which is the median) and may also show the outliers.  It is a simplified way to see the distribution of a variable.  Sometimes multiple box plots (one for each of several variables) are shown side-by-side on a plot, to compare the variables.  How can we create such graphs?
