When designing a study, it is important to choose a sample size that is large
enough to perform a useful test but that is also economically feasible.
How we choose the sample size depends on what test we plan to run on the data
from our study.  Here, let's say our data will be used to compare two population
means.  If we are planning such a study, how do we determine how large it
should be in order for the test that compares the population means to have a
certain power?
