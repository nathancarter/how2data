When trying to find the maximum and minimum values of a multivariate function,
that is a function of multiple real-valued inputs, one of the
main techniques in calculus is to use the "critical points" of the function,
which are the most important inputs to examine to find maxima and minima.
Can we find critical points for a multivariate function using software?
