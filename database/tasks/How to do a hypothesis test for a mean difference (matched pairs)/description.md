Say we have two sets of data that are not independent of each other and come
from a matched-pairs experiment, $(x_1,x'_1),(x_2,x'_2),\ldots,(x_n,x'_n)$.
We want to perform inference on the mean of the differences between these two
samples, that is, the mean of $x_1-x'_1,x_2-x'_2,\ldots,x_n-x'_n$, called $\mu_D$.
We want to determine if it is significantly different from, greater than,
or less than zero (or any other hypothesized value).
We can do so with a two-tailed, right-tailed, or left-tailed hypothesis test
for matched pairs.
