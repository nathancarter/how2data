Assume we have two samples, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ and $x'_1, x'_2, \ldots, x'_n$,
that come from normally distributed populations with known variances,
and the two sample means are $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{x}'$, respectively.
We might want to ask whether the difference $\bar{x}-\bar{x}'$ is significantly
different from, greater than, or less than zero.
