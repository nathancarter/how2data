Let's say we have several independent variables, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$, and a dependent variable $y$.
How can I fit a linear model that uses these independent variables to best predict the dependent variable?

In other words, what are the model coefficients $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_k$ that give me
the best linear model $\hat{y}=\beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x + \cdots + \beta_kx$ based on my data?
