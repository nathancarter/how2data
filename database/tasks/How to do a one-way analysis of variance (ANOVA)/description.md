If we have multiple independent samples of the same quantity
(such as students' SAT scores from several different schools),
we may want to test whether the means of each of the samples
are the same.  Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) can determine whether
any two of the sample means differ significantly.
How can we do an ANOVA?
