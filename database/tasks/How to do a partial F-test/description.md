Let's say we have a multiple linear regression model,

$$\hat{y}=\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \cdots + \beta_kx_k,$$

and we want to test the influence of only some of the coefficients.
For example, we might want to test whether only two of the coefficients are jointly significant.
How do we do so using a partial F-test?
