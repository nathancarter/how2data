When we have qualitative data, we're often interested in performing inference on
population proportions. That is, the proportion (between 0.0 and 1.0) of the
population that is in a certain category with respect to the qualitative
variables. Given a sample proportion, $\bar{p}$, how can we test whether the
population proportion is equal to, greater than, or less than some hypothesized
value?
