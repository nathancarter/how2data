When dealing with qualitative data, we typically measure what proportion of the
population falls into various categories (e.g., which religion a survey
respondent adheres to, if any).  We might want to compare two proportions by
measuring their difference, and asking whether it is equal, greater, or less
than zero. How can we perform such a test?
