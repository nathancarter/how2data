When dealing with qualitative data, we often want to construct a confidence interval
for the difference between two population proportions. For example, if we are trying
a drug on experimental and control groups of patients, we probably want to compare the
proportion of patients who got well in one group versus the other.

How do we make such a comparison using a confidence interval?
