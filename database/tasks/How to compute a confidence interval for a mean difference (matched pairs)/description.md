Say we have two sets of data that are not independent of each other
and come from a matched-pairs experiment, and we want to construct
a confidence interval for the mean difference between these two samples.
How do we make this confidence interval?
Let's assume we've chosen a confidence level of $\alpha$ = 0.05.
