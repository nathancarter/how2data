For those expressions that need the Python math package, use the code
`import math` beforehand to ensure that package is loaded.  Alternatively,
you can write `from math import *` and thus drop the `math` prefixes in
the table below.

| Mathematical notation | R code |
|--|--|
| $x+y$ | `x+y` |
| $x-y$ | `x-y` |
| $xy$ | `x*y` |
| $\frac xy$ | `x/y` |
| $x^y$ | `x^y` |
| $\vert x\vert$ | `abs(x)` |
| $\ln x$ | `log(x)` |
| $\log_a b$ | `log(b,a)` |
| $e^x$ | `exp(x)` |
| $\pi$ | `pi` |
| $\sin x$ | `sin(x)` |
| $\sin^{-1} x$ | `asin(x)` |
| $\sqrt x$ | `sqrt(x)` |

Other trigonometric functions are also available besides just `sin`,
including `cos`, `tan`, etc.

R naturally applies these functions across vectors.  For example, you can
square all the entries in a vector as in the example below.

```{r}
example.vector <- c( -3, 2, 0.5, -1, 10, 9.2, -3.3 )
example.vector ^ 2
```
