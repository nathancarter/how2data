We will create some random data, but thatâ€™s just for demonstration purposes. You can apply the answer below to any data. Simply replace the data variable with your real data (a list, a column of a dataframe, etc.).

```R
data <- rnorm(1000)
```

We can use R's hist() function to create the histogram.

```R
hist(data)
```

The y axis in a histogram is frequency, or the number of occurences. You can change it to probabilities instead.

```R
hist(data, prob = TRUE)
```

You can also choose your own bin boundaries. You might specify the number of bin breaks you want, or you can choose the exact bin breaks that you want.

```R
hist(data, breaks = 8)                # Specify number of bin breaks
hist(data, breaks = c(seq(-5, 5, 1))) # Choose exact bin breaks
```
