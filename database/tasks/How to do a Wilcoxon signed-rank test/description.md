If we have sample with a pretty small size or that is non-normal, we may want to perform inference about its median. More specifically, we may want to test whether the sample median is significantly different from, greater than, or less than a hypothesized value, and we can do that with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. How do we go about that?


Assume we a sample of data, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots x_k$ and either the sample
size is small or the population is not normally distributed.  But we still want
to perform tests that compare the sample median to a hypothesized value (equal,
greater, or less). One method is the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test.
