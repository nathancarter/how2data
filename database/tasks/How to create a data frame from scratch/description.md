Sometimes it is useful to create a small table of data directly in code,
without first needing to store the data in a file and load it from there.
This can be useful for creating small tables for testing purposes,
or for creating small lookup tables that hold abbreviations, IDs, etc.
What's the easiest way to build such a table?
