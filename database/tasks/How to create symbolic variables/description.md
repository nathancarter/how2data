The word "variable" does not mean the same thing in mathematics as it does
in computer programming.  In mathematics, we often use it to mean an unknown
for which we might solve; but in programming, variables typically have known
values.

If we want to do symbolic mathematics in a software package, how can we tell
the computer that we want to use variables in the mathematical sense, as
symbols whose value may be unknown?
