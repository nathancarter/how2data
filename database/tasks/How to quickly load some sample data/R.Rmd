R comes with many datasets in its `datasets` package.
Ensure that you have it installed as follows.

```{r}
library(datasets)
```

Then you can load any one of them with the `data` function, as follows.

```{r}
data(iris)  # Load the famous Fisher's irises dataset.
head(iris)  # It has been placed in a variable of the same name.
```

To page through a list of all available datasets, just call `data()` with no arguments.
