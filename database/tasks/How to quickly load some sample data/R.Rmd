R comes with many built-in datasets.  You can load any one of them with the built-in,
global `data` function, as follows.

```{r}
data(iris)  # Load the famous Fisher's irises dataset.
iris        # It has been placed in a variable of the same name.
```

To page through a list of all available datasets, just call `data()` with no arguments.
