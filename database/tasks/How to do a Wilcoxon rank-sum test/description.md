Assume we have two independent samples of data, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots x_k$ and
$x'_1, x'_2, x'_3, \ldots x'_k$, each from a different population.
Also assume that the sample sizes are small or the populations are not normally
distributed.  How can we test whether there is a significant difference
between the two medians (or if one is significantly greater than or less than
the other)? One method is the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test.
