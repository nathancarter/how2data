A Taylor series approximation of degree $n$ to the function $f(x)$,
centered at the point $x=a$, has an error bounded by the following formula,
where $c$ ranges over all points between $x=a$ and the point $x=x_0$ at
which we will be applying the approximation.

$$ \frac{|x_0-a|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\max|f^{(n+1)}(c)| $$

How can we compute this error bound using mathematical software?
