The solution below uses an example dataset about the teeth of 10 guinea pigs at three Vitamin C dosage levels (in mg) with two delivery methods (orange juice vs. ascorbic acid).  (See how to quickly load some sample data.)

```{r}
df <- ToothGrowth
```

To obtain the descriptive statistics of the quantitative column (`len` for length of teeth) based on the treatment levels (`supp`), we can use either the `tapply` or `favstats` functions.

```{r}
attach(df)
tapply(len, supp, summary)
```

You can replace `summary` in the call to `tapply` with `mean`, `median`, `max`, `min`, or `quantile` to get just one value.  An example is shown below for quantiles.

```{r}
tapply(len, supp, quantile, prob = 0.25, data=df) # 1st quartile
```
