If we have samples from several independent populations, we might want to test
whether the population medians are equal.
We may not be able to assume anything about the populations' variances,
nor whether they are normally distributed, but we do assume that the
populations have distributions that are approximately the same shape.
The Kruskal-Wallis Test will allow us to test the medians for equality.
It is similar to a One-Way ANOVA but using medians instead of means.
How do we perform a Kruskal-Wallis Test?
