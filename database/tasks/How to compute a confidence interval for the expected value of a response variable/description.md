If we have a simple linear regression model, $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon$,
where $\epsilon$ is some random error, then given any $x$ input, $y$ can be veiwed as
a random variable because of $\epsilon$. Let's consider its expected value.
How do we construct a confidence interval for that expected value,
given a value for the predictor $x$?
