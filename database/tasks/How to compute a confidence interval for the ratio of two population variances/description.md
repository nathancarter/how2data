Let's say we want to compute a confidence interval for two population variances.
We take two samples of data, $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_k$ and $x'_1, x'_2, x'_3, \ldots, x'_k$,
and compute their variances, $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$.
How do we compute a confidence interval for $\frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_2^2}$?
