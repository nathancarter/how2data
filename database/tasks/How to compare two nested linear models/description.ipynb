        "Model $A$ is said to be \"nested\" in model $B$ if the predictors included in $A$ are a subset of those included in $B$.  In such a situation, how can we determine if the larger model (in this case $B$) is significantly better than the smaller (reduced) model?  We can use an Extra Sums of Squares test, also called a partial $F$-test, to compare two nested linear.\n",
