We often want to know whether a set of data is normally distributed,
so that we can deduce what inference tests are appropriate to conduct.
If we have a set of data and want to figure out if it comes from a population
that follows a normal distribution, one tool that can help is a QQ plot.
How do we make and interpret one?
