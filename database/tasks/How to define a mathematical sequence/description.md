In mathematics, a sequence is an infinite list of values, typically
real numbers, often written $a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots$, or collectively as $a_n$.

(Let's assume that sequences are indexed starting with index 0, at $a_0$,
even though some definitions start with index 1, at $a_1$, instead.)

How can we express sequences in mathematical software?
