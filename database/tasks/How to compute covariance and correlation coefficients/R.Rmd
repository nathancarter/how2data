We will construct some random data here, but when applying this, you would use your own data, of course.

```{r}
# Create a dataframe with random values between 0 and 1
set.seed(1)
df <- as.data.frame(matrix(runif(n=50,min=0,max=1),nrow = 10))
names(df) <- c('col1','col2','col3','col4','col5')
head(df)
```

In R, we can use the `cov()` function to calculate the covariance between two variables. The default method is Pearson.

```{r}
cov( df$col1, df$col2 )
```

You can also compare all of a DataFrame's columns among one another, each as a separate variable.

```{r}
cov(df)
```

The Pearson correlation coefficient can be computed with `cor()` in place of `cov()`.

```{r}
cor(df$col1,df$col2)
```

And you can compute correlation coefficients for all numeric columns in a DataFrame.

```{r}
cor(df)
```
