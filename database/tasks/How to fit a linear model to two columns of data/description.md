Let's say we have two columns of data, one for a single independent variable
$x$ and the other for a single dependent variable $y$.  How can I find the
best fit linear model that predicts $y$ based on $x$?

In other words, what are the model coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ that
give me the best linear model $\hat y=\beta_0+\beta_1x$ based on my data?
