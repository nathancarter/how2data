If we have a set of data that seems normally distributed, how can we compute a
confidence interval for the mean?  Assume we have some confidence level
already chosen, such as $\alpha=0.05$.

We will use the normal distribution, which assumes either that we know
the population standard deviation, or we have a large enough sample size
(typically at least 30).  If neither of these is true in your case,
then you can use $t$-scores instead;
see how to compute a confidence interval for a population mean.
