# Welcome to *How to Data!*

## Our goals

This is a how-to website for students of data science.  It will contain
answers to a wide variety of [how-to questions](../tasks) about data-related
[software and programming languages](../software).  It is organized around
[student coursework](../topics).

It began at [Bentley University](http://www.bentley.edu), but accepts
contributions from any school or business, and is happy to work with you to
add content that would be useful to your students or employees.  See the
[Contributing page](../contributing) for details.
