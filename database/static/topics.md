# Topics

## What is a "topic?"

Although this website is focused mostly on [tasks](tasks),
it can be helpful to have them organized in some way.
We organize them into *topics.*

A topic can be a course at a univeristy or other school,
a textbook, a field of study, or any other category into which we can
collect tasks in a way that's helpful this site's readers.

## All topics, in alphabetical order

No problem!  Just [email the site's maintainer](mailto:ncarter@bentley.edu)
and state your course and what's in it.  We'll create a topic page for you,
where you can browse tasks and their solutions or download the whole course
as a PDF in any of the software packages the site supports.
