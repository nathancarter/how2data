SET_OF_SOFTWARE_PACKAGES

## Under Construction

We will add additional software packages in time.  Our initial priorities are on
the two programming languages used in data-related courses at Bentley University,
where this website is being created (and those are Python and R).  Natural next
steps include languages like Julia and popular software like Excel, SPSS, etc.
