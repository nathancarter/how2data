# Contributing to *How to Data*

By contributing to *How to Data,* you're permitting your work to be used under
the same license as the rest of the site.  See licensing information in the
README of [our GitHub repository](http://www.github.com/nathancarter/how2data/).

## If you've come to this page because you have a question...

You probably want to be browsing our [Tasks page](../tasks).

If your question isn't there, this site may not be the right place for you.
It's a reference for common questions, not a place to ask individual questions.
We highly recommend the following websites that answer custom/individual
questions.

 * For programming questions: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
 * For statistics questions: [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)
 * For mathematics questions: [Math Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)

## If you've come to this page because there's a mistake on our site...

Please tell us!  The best way to do so is to file a new
[issue](https://github.com/nathancarter/how2data/issues) in our source code
repository.

## If you've come to this page because you have a suggested improvement...

Great!  You can make the edit yourself, and we'll review it for inclusion.
Here's how:

 1. View whichever solution you'd like to improve.
 2. At the bottom of the page, click the link that says "edit the source."
 3. Click the pencil icon on the right above the page content to start editing.
 4. Under the "Commit changes" heading, write a short phrase to explain what
    you're submitting, such as "Fixing incorrect RMSE formula."
 5. Make sure you're creating a new branch and a pull request. (A "pull
    request" is a request for the *How to Data* maintainers to review and
    accept your submission.)
 6. Click "Commit changes."

## If you've come to this page because you want to create new content...

Excellent!  Download
[this zipped folder](../assets/downloads/examples-for-contributing-to-how-to-data.zip)
and read the document inside it to see how to get started.  The download
contains example content you can edit to create new tasks and/or solutions
that are then ready to upload, following the instructions in the document.

When writing new content, please follow these guidelines:

 * **Write plenty of explanations.**  Comments in code are great.  Comments
   between code cells are great.  Explain everything you're doing in your
   code.
 * **Break your work into bite-sized pieces.**  Really large chunks of complex
   code are not helpful to learners.  If you have many nested function calls,
   consider breaking them down into small assignment statements instead.
 * **Use helpful names for variables and functions.**  Do not call a variable
   `t` when you could call it `seconds_elapsed`.  Do not call a function
   `convert` when you could call it `inches_to_cm`.
