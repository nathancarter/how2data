# Contributing to *How to Data*

## Under Construction

This website has just begun!  Check back later when this page has been expanded to explain:

 * how individuals can get involved by contributing content
 * resources to help you create and format your submissions
 * best practices for doing so, including
    * writing lots of comments
    * breaking code into short lines rather than nested function calls
    * helpful variable names
