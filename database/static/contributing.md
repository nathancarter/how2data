# Contributing to *How to Data*

By contributing to *How to Data,* you're permitting your work to be used under
the same license as the rest of the site.  See licensing information in the
README of [our GitHub repository](http://www.github.com/nathancarter/how2data/).

## If you've come to this page because you have a question...

You probably want to be browsing our [Tasks page](../tasks).

If your question isn't there, this site may not be the right place for you.
It's a reference for common questions, not a place to ask individual questions.
We highly recommend the following websites that answer custom/individual
questions.

 * For programming questions: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
 * For statistics questions: [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)
 * For mathematics questions: [Math Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)

## If you've come to this page because there's a mistake on our site...

Please tell us!  The best way to do so is to file a new
[issue](https://github.com/nathancarter/how2data/issues) in our source code
repository.

## If you've come to this page because you have a suggested improvement...

Great!  You can make the edit yourself, and we'll review it for inclusion.
Here's how:

 1. View whichever solution you'd like to improve.
 2. At the bottom of the page, click the link that says "edit the source."
 3. Click the pencil icon on the right above the page content to start editing.
 4. Under the "Commit changes" heading, write a short phrase to explain what
    you're submitting, such as "Fixing incorrect RMSE formula."
 5. Make sure you're creating a new branch and a pull request. (A "pull
    request" is a request for the *How to Data* maintainers to review and
    accept your submission.)
 6. Click "Commit changes."

## If you've come to this page because you want to add a new topic...

Excellent!  The [current list of topics](../topics) focuses on courses at
Bentley University, where this website began.  But we'd love to support your institution
as well!  Since the first few courses in statistics and data science include much of
the same material across institutions, the website probably already contains most of the
[tasks](../tasks) (and their solutions!) that you need.  Feel free to reach out directly
[to the site maintainer by email](mailto:ncarter@bentley.edu) and he can easily help you
add a new topic to the site just through an email conversation.

## If you've come to this page because you want to create new tasks or solutions...

Excellent!  [The wiki on our GitHub page](https://github.com/nathancarter/how2data/wiki)
will tell you everything you need to know about getting started as a How to Data
developer, whether you're planning a small contribution (like one new solution)
or have big plans (like improving the website build process itself).
We're happy to help you get on board!
