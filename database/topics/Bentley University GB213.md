The description from the course catalog can be found
[here](https://catalog.bentley.edu/undergraduate/courses/gb/).
Topics included in the course are listed as
[tasks](../tasks) below.

Mathematical topics include random variables,
discrete and continuous probability distributions,
confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, single-variable linear models,
and optionally ANOVA and/or $\chi^2$ tests, time permitting.
