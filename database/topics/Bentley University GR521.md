GR521 is a graduate Managerial Statistics course at Bentley University.
The description from the course catalog can be found
[here](https://catalog.bentley.edu/graduate/graduate-courses/gr/).

Mathematical topics include random variables,
discrete and continuous probability distributions,
confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, single-variable linear models,
and optionally advanced topics such as data mining, time permitting.

## Basics

 * How to do basic mathematical computations
 * How to compute summary statistics

## Random variables and probability distributions

 * How to generate random values from a distribution
 * How to compute probabilities from a distribution
 * How to plot continuous probability distributions
 * How to plot discrete probability distributions

## Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing

 * How to compute a confidence interval for a sample mean
 * How to do a two-sided hypothesis test for a sample mean
 * How to do a two-sided hypothesis test for two sample means

## Linear modeling

 * How to fit a linear model to two columns of data
 * How to compute R-squared for a simple linear model

## Other end-of-semester topics, time permitting
