GR526 is a graduate course at Bentley University that gives an overview of
Calculus from a computational viewpoint,
for students who plan to study quantitative finance.
The description from the course catalog can be found
[here](https://catalog.bentley.edu/graduate/graduate-courses/gr/).

Topics include limits, derivatives, integrals, differential equations,
implicit differentiation, Taylor series, and continuous probability.
By-hand computation is minimized and the use of a computer algebra system is
required, such as Maxima or SymPy.

## Symbolic mathematics

 * How to do basic mathematical computations
 * How to create symbolic variables
 * How to substitute a value for a symbolic variable
 * How to graph mathematical functions
 * How to write a piecewise-defined function

## Limits

 * How to compute the limit of a function

## Under Construction

This topic will be expanded later.  This is just a placeholder for now.
