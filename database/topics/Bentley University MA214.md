MA214 is an undergraduate statistics course at Bentley University
that builds on the basic managerial statistics course taken by all students.
The description from the course catalog can be found
[here](https://catalog.bentley.edu/undergraduate/courses/ma/).

It covers hypothesis tests, analysis of variance, multiple regression,
and contingency tables.
