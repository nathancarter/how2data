MA252 is an undergraduate statistics course at Bentley University
that focuses on model building using regression.
The description from the course catalog can be found
[here](https://catalog.bentley.edu/undergraduate/courses/ma/).

It covers simple linear regression, multivariate linear regression,
logistic linear regression, model building, transformations, and
interactions.

## Simple Linear Regression

 * How to fit a linear model to two columns of data
 * How to compute a confidence interval for the expected value of a response variable
 * How to compute R-squared for a simple linear model
 * How to predict the response variable in a linear model

## Multivariate Linear Regression

 * How to fit a multivariate linear model
 * How to compute a confidence interval for a regression coefficient
 * How to compute adjusted R-squared
 * How to do a test of joint significance

## Model Building

 * How to compute covariance and correlation coefficients
 * How to compute the standard error of the estimate for a model
 * How to do a hypothesis test of a coefficient's significance
 * How to do a Spearman rank correlation test

## Residual Analysis

 * How to compute the residuals of a linear model
