MA255 is an undergraduate statistics course at Bentley University
on the Design of Experiments.
The description from the course catalog can be found
[here](https://catalog.bentley.edu/undergraduate/courses/ma/).

The course covers various experimental designs including factorial
and fractional factorial designs, interaction among factors,
and applications in management (including cost savings and policy making)
as well as in marketing.
